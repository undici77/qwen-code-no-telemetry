# Daemon Multi-Workspace Phase 4: Workspace-Qualified ACP

## Summary

This document designs Phase 4 of issue #6378: workspace-qualified ACP for
`qwen serve`. It builds directly on the Phase 3 workspace-qualified REST branch
(`codex/phase3-workspace-qualified-rest`, PR #6567), which is **not yet merged**
(state `CHANGES_REQUESTED`). Phase 4 mounts a per-workspace ACP endpoint at
`/workspaces/:workspace/acp`, gives each workspace runtime its own ACP
dispatcher and connection state, and lets the Web Shell pick a workspace from
`/capabilities`. Legacy `/acp` stays bound to the primary runtime so existing
Web Shell and ACP clients are unaffected.

Phase 4 is scoped to the ACP transport (Streamable HTTP + the reverse `/acp`
WebSocket, its mirrored workspace methods, and reverse MCP/CDP). Voice
(`/workspaces/:workspace/voice/stream`) and daemon-managed channel workers are
**Phase 4b**; dynamic workspace add/remove is **Phase 5**. Neither is in scope
here.

The core finding from the seam investigation: Phase 4 is mostly a _wiring and
routing_ change, not a rewrite. `AcpDispatcher` is already workspace-bound by
construction, its `workspaceCwd` consistency check already exists, Phase 3
already made the mirrored REST surface per-runtime, and `clientMcpSenderRegistry`
is already a per-runtime field. The real work is (1) turning the single ACP mount
into one dispatcher per runtime (each with its own remember-lane; still one
`mountAcpHttp` call and one upgrade listener; an `AcpHttpHandle` that owns every
runtime's registry), (2) extending that WebSocket upgrade listener to dispatch by
URL path, (3) keeping the device-flow registry daemon-global and shared across
every mount (with best-effort event-sink fan-out to each trusted runtime's
bridge), and (4) syncing the
new `workspace_qualified_acp` capability tag across the SDK/CLI capability types
and tests.

## Systematic rework (hardening, PR #6621)

Review surfaced a Critical: an earlier iteration made the device-flow registry
per-runtime, which left secondary mounts unauthenticated (`device_flow "not
configured"`). The ACP mount was reworked along eight axes; the final
architecture is:

1. **Runtime ACP mount factory.** One `mountAcpHttp` call owns a `primaryMount`
   plus a `secondaryMounts` map (one `RuntimeAcpMount` per non-primary runtime),
   each carrying a `primary` flag. HTTP and WS both resolve a mount by selector
   and delegate to shared handlers.
2. **Routing + connection isolation.** The plural selector aliases the primary
   workspace to `primaryMount`, and resolves a per-runtime mount otherwise.
   Untrusted non-primary workspaces are rejected (403) on both the HTTP and WS
   paths before any child is spawned.
3. **Raw request-target WS parsing.** The upgrade listener parses the raw
   request-target (not `new URL().pathname`, which normalizes `%2e%2e`), so a
   non-normalized dot-segment / backslash selector is destroyed before routing.
4. **Daemon-global device-flow + fan-out.** The device-flow registry stays a
   single daemon instance (OAuth credentials are process-global). Secondary
   mounts share it via `opts.deviceFlowRegistry`; auth-flow events fan out
   best-effort to every trusted runtime's bridge (`resolveEventBridges`).
5. **Primary-only CDP + client-MCP.** CDP-tunnel claims are gated on
   `activeMount.primary`; the plural POST returns the dispatch promise.
6. **Disposed lifecycle gate.** After `dispose()`, the shared HTTP handlers
   return `503 server_disposed` instead of racing torn-down registries during
   the shutdown drain. `dispose()` is idempotent.
7. **Aggregate observability.** `AcpHttpHandle.getSnapshot()` sums connection
   and WS-stream counts across the primary and every secondary mount, so daemon
   metrics report all workspaces' ACP connections, not just the primary's.
8. **Capability advertisement.** `resolveAcpHttpEnabled()` is the single
   interpretation of `QWEN_SERVE_ACP_HTTP`; `workspace_qualified_acp` is
   advertised only when the ACP HTTP surface is enabled **and** multi-workspace
   sessions are active.

## Post-review seam hardening

The mount architecture above remains unchanged. The final repair pass closes
six boundary gaps without replacing `AcpHttpHandle` or introducing a new route
policy module.

1. **One qualified-route readiness decision.** Workspace-qualified ACP is ready
   only when ACP HTTP is enabled and the workspace registry contains more than
   one runtime. HTTP route registration, WebSocket path recognition, capability
   advertisement, and the outer rate-limiter exemption must agree with that
   decision. Single-workspace daemons continue to expose legacy `/acp` only.
2. **One rate-limit charge.** The outer Express limiter precisely exempts an
   enabled `/workspaces/<single-selector>/acp` transport path, including the
   route's existing case and trailing-slash behavior. Nearby paths remain
   limited. The ACP transport remains responsible for applying the JSON-RPC
   method tier, so a qualified prompt consumes only the prompt bucket rather
   than both mutation and prompt buckets.
3. **Structured malformed-path failure.** Express route-parameter decoding
   failures that are both `URIError` instances and marked with HTTP status 400
   return a structured `400 invalid_request`. Other thrown `URIError` values and
   unrelated failures retain the generic 500 handling. The WebSocket path keeps
   its existing explicit 400 response.
4. **Log-safe selectors.** A decoded selector used in an operator-facing
   WebSocket rejection log passes through the existing `logSafe` sanitizer, so
   encoded terminal controls cannot forge or split stderr lines.
5. **Terminal disposal.** `dispose()` is an irreversible lifecycle transition.
   After it runs, `attachServer()` cannot recreate a WebSocket server or upgrade
   listener. Repeated `dispose()` and `attachServer()` calls remain harmless.
6. **Workspace-attributed full diagnostics.** The aggregate ACP snapshot gains
   additive connection diagnostics decorated with `workspaceId`,
   `workspaceCwd`, and `primary`. Summary counters remain unchanged, the public
   primary `registry` remains available for compatibility, and daemon
   `detail=full` reads the aggregate connection list. The existing connection
   cap remains a per-mount limit because every mount is constructed with the
   same configured cap.

Each contract is pinned by a regression test written before its production
change. Verification includes the focused ACP, rate-limit, daemon-status, and
serve-server suites plus build, typecheck, lint, and the serve fast-path bundle
closure check.

## Dependencies on Phase 3 (unmerged)

Phase 4 consumes these Phase 3 seams. Because PR #6567 is `CHANGES_REQUESTED`,
treat them as _to-be-stabilized_; Phase 4 implementation must rebase onto the
merged Phase 3.

- `packages/cli/src/serve/workspace-route-runtime.ts`:
  - `resolveRegisteredWorkspaceRuntimeByPathSelector(registry, selector)` — pure
    function, returns `WorkspaceRuntime | undefined`. **Reusable by the WS
    upgrade listener** (see Open Questions).
  - `resolveWorkspaceRuntimeFromParam(registry, req, res, param)` — Express-bound
    (writes `res.status().json()`). **Usable for the HTTP ACP routes, not for the
    WS upgrade path** (the upgrade listener has only a raw `IncomingMessage` +
    `socket`, no Express `res`).
  - `requireTrustedWorkspaceRuntime(runtime, res)` — Express-bound trust gate,
    reused by the HTTP ACP routes.
  - `isPortableAbsolutePath` / `sendWorkspaceMismatch` — reused for selector
    parsing and error shape.
- Per-runtime REST handlers registered in `server.ts`
  (`registerWorkspaceQualified{FileRead,FileWrite,Trust,Status,Permissions,Settings,Lifecycle,McpControl,Tools}Routes`).
  The ACP dispatcher mirrors these surfaces; Phase 4 relies on their per-runtime
  behavior existing.
- `/capabilities` `workspaces[]` (Phase 2a), built in
  `packages/cli/src/serve/routes/capabilities.ts` (L79-84) and mirrored in
  `packages/cli/src/serve/daemon-status.ts` (L432-437) with `id` / `cwd` /
  `primary` / `trusted` per runtime. Feature-flag declarations and their
  advertise/toggle predicates live in
  `packages/cli/src/serve/capabilities.ts`.

## Baseline: current ACP seam (Phase 3 tree)

- `mountAcpHttp(app, primaryBridge, opts)` in
  `packages/cli/src/serve/acp-http/index.ts` is called once from `server.ts`
  (L1226-1275) with **all-primary** inputs: `primaryBridge`,
  `primaryBoundWorkspace`, `primaryWorkspace`, `primaryRouteFileSystemFactory`,
  the app-global `deviceFlowRegistry`, `primaryRuntime.clientMcpSenderRegistry`,
  and `primaryRuntime.env` (for the voice `extraWsRoute`).
- One dispatcher per mount: `mountAcpHttp` builds a single `AcpDispatcher` and a
  single `ConnectionRegistry`, and returns an `AcpHttpHandle` whose `registry` is
  that single registry and whose `attachServer` installs exactly one
  `httpServer.on('upgrade', ...)` listener (index.ts L1536, L1555). `dispose`
  removes that one listener and closes that one registry (index.ts L1543-1553).
- **Single WebSocket upgrade listener** (index.ts `setupWebSocket`, upgrade
  handler at L903-1045). It is installed once via
  `AcpHttpHandle.attachServer(server)` after `listen()`. It:
  - parses the upgrade URL,
  - rejects any path that is not `opts.path` (`/acp`), not `/cdp`, and not an
    `extraWsRoutes` entry — `socket.destroy()` on unknown path (index.ts
    L935-939),
  - runs shared security checks (loopback, host allowlist, CSRF/origin, bearer
    token) for **all** paths,
  - then branches: `/cdp` -> `attachCdpClient`; `extraRoute` -> `onConnection`;
    else the ACP initialize handshake.
  - The doc comment at L328-337 is explicit: a second `'upgrade'` listener cannot
    coexist because this one destroys unknown paths. Phase 4 must extend this one
    listener, not add another.
- `AcpDispatcher` (dispatch.ts L644-656) is already workspace-bound by
  constructor: `bridge`, `boundWorkspace`, `workspace`, `workspaceRememberLane`,
  `fsFactory?`, `deviceFlowRegistry?`, `sessionShellCommandEnabled`, `registry?`,
  `archiveCoordinator`. Every mirrored workspace method it serves reads these
  fields, so binding a dispatcher to a runtime automatically scopes file /
  permissions / settings / trust / tools / mcp / memory / agents / auth to that
  runtime.
- Two of those dispatcher deps are single-instance bound to primary today:
  `workspaceRememberLane = new WorkspaceRememberTaskLane(primaryBridge)`
  (server.ts L816) and `archiveCoordinator = new SessionArchiveCoordinator()`
  (server.ts L596). `sessionShellCommandEnabled` is a global policy, safe to
  share.
- Consistency check already exists: `parseRequestedWorkspace` (dispatch.ts
  L694-697) throws `WorkspaceMismatchError` when a request's `workspaceCwd` does
  not equal `this.boundWorkspace`; the error maps to `INVALID_PARAMS` (L577).
- `WorkspaceRuntime` (workspace-registry.ts L28-38) carries
  `clientMcpSenderRegistry` per runtime but has **no `deviceFlowRegistry`
  field** — device-flow is still app-global (`setupDeviceFlowRegistry({ app,
bridge })` at server.ts L609, bound to the primary bridge).

## Architecture: per-runtime ACP mount

Keep Option B: one daemon, N independent workspace runtimes. For ACP:

- Each registered runtime gets its own `AcpDispatcher` + `ConnectionRegistry` +
  reverse-MCP provider factory, all bound to that runtime's `bridge` /
  `workspace` / `routeFileSystemFactory` / `clientMcpSenderRegistry` / `env`.
  Every dispatcher receives the same daemon-global device-flow registry.
- Legacy `/acp` stays bound to the primary runtime's dispatcher (unchanged wire
  behavior).
- New `/workspaces/:workspace/acp` binds to the resolved runtime's dispatcher.
- **Invariant: `mountAcpHttp` is still called exactly once** and installs exactly
  one `httpServer.on('upgrade', ...)` listener. It changes from "single bridge +
  opts" to accepting the `WorkspaceRegistry` (plus shared, non-workspace
  concerns: token, allowedOrigins, hostname, `checkRate`,
  `sessionShellCommandEnabled`, `cdpTunnelRegistry`). Internally it builds a
  `Map<workspaceId, RuntimeAcpMount>`; the primary entry stays addressable by the
  legacy `/acp` path.
- Each `RuntimeAcpMount` is constructed with that runtime's own `bridge`,
  `workspace`, `routeFileSystemFactory`, `clientMcpSenderRegistry`, `env`, a new
  per-runtime `WorkspaceRememberTaskLane(runtime.bridge)`, its `AcpDispatcher`,
  and its `ConnectionRegistry`. The daemon-global device-flow registry,
  `archiveCoordinator`, and `sessionShellCommandEnabled` are shared.
- All four dispatch entry points must select the resolved runtime's mount, not
  the primary one: `POST`, `GET` (SSE), and `DELETE` on the plural path (Express,
  via `resolveWorkspaceRuntimeFromParam`; today each closes over the single
  dispatcher at index.ts L533/L675/L849), plus the WS upgrade branch (below).
  Legacy `/acp` POST/GET/DELETE/upgrade keep dispatching to primary.
- `AcpHttpHandle` must grow from a single `registry` to owning every runtime's
  dispatcher + `ConnectionRegistry`; `dispose` closes all of them and removes the
  single upgrade listener.
- Session lifecycle: ACP `session/new` / `load` / `resume` on a plural mount must
  fire the same bridge-lifecycle `register` / `remove` callbacks that feed the
  Phase 2b `WorkspaceSessionOwnerIndex` (workspace-registry.ts L48-119). A session
  created over `/workspaces/B/acp` must then be discoverable by REST owner-routed
  reads (context, stats, etc.) and vice versa. Phase 2b already scoped this index
  to cover "REST and the later ACP dispatcher"; Phase 4 is where the ACP side is
  actually wired.

## WebSocket upgrade dispatch (core design)

The upgrade listener is the one place ACP routing is not Express-driven, so it
needs explicit path handling.

- Keep the shared security checks (loopback / host allowlist / CSRF / bearer)
  exactly as they are, applied uniformly before any workspace resolution.
- Extend path classification. Today: `pathname === '/acp' | '/cdp' | extraRoute`.
  Phase 4 adds a branch for `/workspaces/:workspace/acp`:
  1. Match the prefix and extract the raw `:workspace` selector segment.
  2. Resolve with the pure function
     `resolveRegisteredWorkspaceRuntimeByPathSelector(registry, decodeURIComponent(selector))`
     (id-first, then encoded canonical cwd, matching the REST resolver).
  3. On no match: reject the upgrade with a 400-class close
     (`socket.write('HTTP/1.1 400 ...')` + `destroy()`), mirroring the REST
     `workspace_mismatch`. No fallback to primary.
  4. On match: run the ACP initialize handshake against the resolved runtime's
     dispatcher + `ConnectionRegistry` (not the primary ones).
- Reverse `/cdp` and voice `extraWsRoutes` stay primary-bound in Phase 4 (voice
  is 4b). The `/cdp` branch is unchanged.
- Legacy `/acp` upgrade continues to bind to the primary dispatcher.
- `%2F` in the encoded cwd selector: the daemon parses the raw upgrade URL
  itself (`new URL(req.url, ...)`), so it is not subject to Express path
  decoding, but reverse proxies may still normalize `%2F`. Recommend the
  `id`-based selector for WS in proxy deployments (same guidance as Phase 2b/3
  REST). The HTTP plural routes instead reuse `resolveWorkspaceRuntimeFromParam`,
  which reads `req.params` (Express decodes once), so they inherit the Phase 3
  encoded-selector handling for free.
- Observability: the WS upgrade path and its ACP dispatch bypass Express
  middleware, so daemon telemetry/logging must stamp the resolved workspace
  explicitly here (the same reason `checkRate` is threaded through `opts`); the
  Phase 1 request-time workspace hashing only covers Express routes.

## Per-runtime device-flow registry (superseded — see "Systematic rework" axis 4)

> design-history context and do not describe the shipped behavior.

Device-flow is the one mirrored surface that is still app-global and must change.

- Add `deviceFlowRegistry` to `WorkspaceRuntime` (or build one per runtime inside
  `mountAcpHttp`). Each runtime's dispatcher receives its own registry.
- `setupDeviceFlowRegistry` must be invoked per runtime (bound to that runtime's
  bridge/env), not once against the primary bridge.
- Workspace-qualified auth routes/methods
  (`GET/DELETE /workspaces/:workspace/auth/device-flow/:id` and the ACP
  `_qwen/workspace/auth/device_flow/*` methods) must resolve the target runtime's
  registry and reject/hide flows that belong to another workspace.
- Shutdown must dispose every runtime's registry, not just
  `app.locals.deviceFlowRegistry`.
- Auth provider install callbacks are already `boundWorkspace`-scoped inside the
  dispatcher; per-runtime dispatchers make this correct automatically. Legacy
  primary auth routes keep writing primary.

## Dispatcher mirror surface (runtime binding)

The reverse `/acp` WS mirrors a large REST surface (index.ts `WS_READ_METHODS`
L186-219 and dispatch.ts vendor methods): file read/list/glob/stat, workspace
mcp / skills / providers / env / preflight / trust / permissions / voice / tools
/ agents / memory / auth, session groups, setup-github. Because these all read
the dispatcher's constructor fields, binding a dispatcher to a runtime scopes
them for free. Phase 4 does **not** re-implement them; it only ensures each
runtime's dispatcher is constructed with that runtime's dependencies. That set
explicitly includes the per-runtime `deviceFlowRegistry` and
`WorkspaceRememberTaskLane`: if either is left as the primary singleton,
non-primary `_qwen/workspace/memory/remember` and `auth/device_flow` calls would
silently run against the primary bridge.

Consistency guarantee: since each mounted dispatcher is runtime-bound and
`parseRequestedWorkspace` already throws `WorkspaceMismatchError` when a
request's `workspaceCwd` differs from `boundWorkspace`, a client that connects to
`/workspaces/A/acp` but sends `workspaceCwd: B` in params is rejected. Phase 4
should add a test asserting this, and confirm the same guard covers `session/new`
(`parseOptionalWorkspaceCwd`, dispatch.ts L1059).

## Reverse MCP / CDP isolation

- Reverse tool channel: the `clientMcpProviderFactory` currently closes over
  `primaryRuntime.clientMcpSenderRegistry` + `primaryBridge` (server.ts
  L1252-1257). Per-runtime mounts build the factory from the _resolved runtime's_
  `clientMcpSenderRegistry` + `bridge`, so a WS connection on `/workspaces/B/acp`
  registers client-hosted MCP servers in B's runtime only.
- Per-connection `ClientMcpWsConnection` and `cdpEndpoint` stay per-connection;
  they simply attach to the owning runtime's dispatcher.
- CDP tunnel: `cdpTunnelRegistry` is process-scoped and the CDP bridge is claimed
  by an extension `/acp` connection whose `clientInfo.name === 'qwen-cdp-bridge'`.
  Phase 4 keeps CDP claiming on legacy `/acp` (primary) as the pragmatic default;
  workspace-scoped CDP is called out as an Open Question rather than solved here,
  because a single loopback puppeteer client + one `/cdp` endpoint does not map
  cleanly to N runtimes. Concretely, non-primary `RuntimeAcpMount`s must leave
  the `cdpTunnelOverWs` / `/cdp` branch and the `chrome-devtools` runtime-MCP
  registration off; only the primary mount wires them.

## Trust gate

- Untrusted registered workspaces remain visible/read-only but must not spawn a
  child. On `/workspaces/:workspace/acp`, the ownership-granting ops
  (`session/new`, `session/load`, `session/resume`; dispatch.ts
  `CONN_ROUTED_METHODS` L239-243) must reject with an `untrusted_workspace` error
  and not spawn, matching the REST 403 `untrusted_workspace` semantics already
  implemented in `routes/session-runtime.ts` (L39-53) and `routes/session.ts`
  (session create/load/resume trust gates plus `session_workspace_conflict`).
- Reuse the trust decision that Phase 3 exposes via
  `requireTrustedWorkspaceRuntime` for the HTTP ACP routes; for the WS path the
  equivalent check runs on the resolved runtime's `trusted` flag before the
  handshake grants a session.
- Boot-frozen trust is the Phase 2a baseline; runtime trust flips
  (drain/stop the workspace's ACP child + clear its session index on revoke) stay
  aligned with whatever trust-mutation phase lands, and are not re-implemented
  here.

## Capabilities and Web Shell picker

- Add an ACP feature flag (e.g. `workspace_qualified_acp`) in
  `packages/cli/src/serve/capabilities.ts` (flag declaration + advertise/toggle
  predicate), advertised only when more than one runtime is registered and ACP is
  enabled (mirror the `multi_workspace_sessions` gating at capabilities.ts
  L408-409). If Phase 4 lands across multiple PRs, do not advertise the tag until
  the full plural ACP loop (HTTP + WS + device-flow + owner-index wiring) is
  complete, so clients never build `/workspaces/:id/acp` URLs against a half-wired
  surface (same half-enable guard philosophy as the Phase 2a feature gate).
  Update the note on `workspace_qualified_rest_core` (L264-271) that currently
  says "ACP/WebSocket, auth, voice, and extensions stay on their existing
  primary-workspace routes in this phase."
- Adding the tag is not local to `capabilities.ts`. It must be synced to: the
  `/capabilities` response builder in `routes/capabilities.ts`, the SDK
  capability types (`packages/sdk-typescript/src/daemon/types.ts`), the CLI serve
  types (`packages/cli/src/serve/types.ts`), and the feature-set assertion in
  `server.test.ts` (L376-381). This is required Phase 4 work, not optional.
- `workspaces[]` already exists (Phase 2a), built in `routes/capabilities.ts`
  (L79-84) and `daemon-status.ts` (L432-437) with `id` / `cwd` / `primary` /
  `trusted` per runtime. The Web Shell reads it and builds `/workspaces/:id/acp`
  connection URLs; the picker disables (or read-only marks) untrusted entries.
- The SDK `DaemonClient` (added in Phase 3) already reads `caps.workspaces[].cwd`
  for session routing; a workspace-qualified ACP connect helper is the natural
  extension. The capability-type sync above is required; the connect helper
  itself can follow.

## Failure paths

- `workspace_mismatch`: unknown WS/HTTP selector -> 400-class reject; never fall
  back to primary.
- `untrusted_workspace`: ownership-granting ACP op on an untrusted runtime ->
  reject, no spawn.
- `workspaceCwd` param mismatch: `WorkspaceMismatchError` -> `INVALID_PARAMS`
  (already wired).
- Child crash: isolated to the owning runtime; other runtimes' dispatchers and
  connections are unaffected (larger single-daemon fault radius is a documented
  known limitation).
- Trust revoked: when a trust-mutation phase lands, revoking a runtime must
  drain/stop its ACP child and clear its session index; Phase 4 only guarantees
  the per-runtime ACP mount is drainable, it does not add trust mutation itself.
- Global shutdown: dispose every runtime's `ConnectionRegistry`, then dispose the
  single daemon-global device-flow registry once.
- Rate limiting: ACP HTTP/WS admission uses `checkRate` keyed per
  connection/session (index.ts L627-641, L1175-1178). The plural mounts share the
  one limiter; keys must stay unambiguous across runtimes so one workspace cannot
  exhaust or bypass another's budget.
- Capacity: `maxConnections` is enforced per-runtime `ConnectionRegistry`, so
  total ACP connections scale to N x `maxConnections` (a per-workspace budget,
  matching the `maxSessions` per-workspace model). Fresh-session total stays
  bounded by the Phase 2a `maxTotalSessions` admission at the bridge seam, which
  ACP session creation already passes through.

## Non-goals (Phase 4b / 5)

- `/workspaces/:workspace/voice/stream` and per-workspace voice settings (4b).
- Daemon-managed channel worker grouping / pidfile / status (4b).
- Dynamic workspace add/remove and lazy runtime create (5).

## Test strategy

- WS upgrade dispatch: unit-test path classification — `/acp` (primary),
  `/workspaces/:id/acp` (resolved), unknown selector (reject), `%2F`-encoded cwd
  selector, and that shared security checks still run for the plural path.
- Cross-workspace isolation: a connection on `/workspaces/A/acp` cannot see or
  drive a session owned by B; `session/list` and mirrored reads return only A's
  view.
- Cross-transport ownership: a session created via `/workspaces/B/acp` is
  resolvable by REST owner-routed reads (e.g. `GET /session/:id/stats`) and by
  `resolveLiveSessionOwner`, confirming ACP creation feeds the owner index.
- Consistency: connect to A, send `workspaceCwd: B` -> `WorkspaceMismatchError`.
- Trust gate: `session/new|load|resume` on an untrusted runtime -> rejected, no
  child spawned.
- Device-flow: every mount reaches the daemon-global registry; event publication
  fans out to primary and trusted secondary bridges, one failing bridge does not
  block the others, and shutdown disposes the registry once.
- Reverse MCP: `mcp_register` on `/workspaces/B/acp` lands in B's
  `clientMcpSenderRegistry` and B's bridge only.
- Rate limiting: prompts/mutations on `/workspaces/A/acp` and `/workspaces/B/acp`
  are metered independently and neither can bypass the shared limiter.
- Capabilities: `workspace_qualified_acp` advertised only with >1 runtime;
  `workspaces[]` shape unchanged.

## Open questions / feedback to Phase 3

1. **Keep `resolveRegisteredWorkspaceRuntimeByPathSelector` as a pure function.**
   The WS upgrade listener cannot use the Express-bound
   `resolveWorkspaceRuntimeFromParam`. Phase 4 depends on the pure resolver
   staying free of `req`/`res` coupling. If Phase 3 review changes that seam,
   preserve a pure `(registry, selector) => runtime | undefined` entry point.
2. **Device-flow ownership (resolved).** Keep the registry daemon-global because
   OAuth credentials are process-global. Phase 4 shares that registry with every
   dispatcher and fans sanitized events out to trusted runtime bridges.
3. **CDP tunnel per-workspace model.** One loopback puppeteer client + one `/cdp`
   endpoint does not map cleanly to N runtimes. Phase 4 keeps CDP on primary;
   confirm that is acceptable or scope a workspace-qualified CDP follow-up.
4. **Voice deferral.** Confirm voice stays primary-only until Phase 4b even
   though the ACP dispatcher already exposes `_qwen/workspace/voice` reads.
5. **`archiveCoordinator` scope.** It is a single `SessionArchiveCoordinator`
   today (server.ts L596). Confirm sharing it across runtimes is safe given Phase
   3's workspace-qualified archive/organization, or make it per-runtime.
6. **Rate-limit key dimensioning.** Decide whether ACP plural admission keys need
   an explicit workspace dimension, or whether per-connection/session keys are
   already unambiguous across mounts.
