# Background npm updates

## Problem

The published CLI is code-split into content-hashed JavaScript chunks. Running
`npm install -g` from an active session replaces those chunks in place, so a
later dynamic import in the old process can fail with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.
Deferring the install until session exit avoids corruption, but turns a
background update into an exit-time delay and gives users no benefit until they
leave the session.

## Design

For writable global npm installations, the post-render update check installs
the exact resolved version under a directory derived from the global launcher:

```text
~/.qwen/updates/npm/<launcher-id>/versions/<version>/
```

The version check runs npm in its global context and the staged install uses an
isolated prefix. The staged command explicitly preserves the original global
npm configuration, so changing the prefix does not switch registry or
authentication settings between discovery and installation.

The launcher resolves `QWEN_HOME` from the same home-scoped `.env` files before
selecting a version. This keeps the bootstrap path aligned with CLI storage even
though the full environment loader runs later.

The install and activation run in a detached worker, so quitting the TUI does
not interrupt an update already in progress. After npm exits successfully, the
worker verifies the package name, version, bundle, and launcher, then atomically
writes an `active.json` pointer beside that launcher's versions. The global npm
package is not modified. The already-running process and any child commands it
starts remain pinned to their original build. On the next invocation, the
stable launcher reads the pointer and starts the verified version directory.

Each global npm launcher has its own pointer and version payloads, so
installations under different npm or nvm prefixes can share `~/.qwen` without
overriding one another or sharing dependencies. A slower concurrent update
cannot replace a newer active version.

An incomplete install never changes the active pointer. Before activation, the
worker validates the installed manifest and runs a launcher smoke test. A
missing, malformed, or launcher-mismatched pointer is ignored and the original
npm package remains the fallback. The pointer also records the base package and
launcher identity, so a later explicit global npm install supersedes the
managed version. Because the launcher is not replaced by managed updates,
existing `active.json` fields are a compatibility contract: future changes may
add fields but must not remove or reinterpret them.

Version directories are retained because an older live session may still load
from them. Cleanup is intentionally deferred until disk usage shows that a
lease-based collector is necessary.

## Scope

This changes automatic updates for npm installations only. Other package
managers and standalone archives keep the existing exit-safe behavior until
they have an equivalent immutable-version installation layout.
