# LSP Runtime Hot Reload Design

## Background

This design follows the same layering used by
`mcp-runtime-reinitialization.md`: the CLI decides when to trigger reloads, and
Core decides how to update runtime state. It also reuses the watcher principles
from `settings-change-detection.md`: no filesystem side effects at startup,
debounced changes, semantic diffs, serialized listeners, and listener failures
that do not affect the main session.

The key difference between LSP and MCP is that LSP server configuration does not
live in `settings.json`. Today the native LSP service uses `LspConfigLoader` to
read the workspace `.lsp.json` and enabled extensions' `lspServers`
declarations, writes the result into the single-session `LspServerManager` via
`NativeLspService.discoverAndPrepare()`, and finally starts all configured
servers with `start()`. Therefore `SettingsWatcher` alone cannot detect changes
to the workspace `.lsp.json`.

## Current Code Assessment

- LSP startup is controlled only by `--experimental-lsp` in
  `packages/cli/src/config/config.ts`. There is currently no
  `--allowed-lsp-server-names` flag or equivalent LSP CLI allow-list parameter;
  the existing `--allowed-mcp-server-names` flag is MCP-only.
- `NativeLspService` is constructed once during CLI config loading. The startup
  path calls `discoverAndPrepare()`, then `start()`, then wraps the service in
  `NativeLspClient` and attaches it to `Config`.
- `Config.setLspClient()` and `Config.setLspInitializationError()` currently
  throw after initialization, so runtime hot reload should not replace the
  client object. It should keep the existing `NativeLspClient` and only
  incrementally reconcile the service behind it.
- `LspConfigLoader` only reads the workspace `.lsp.json` and active extensions'
  `lspServers`. The workspace `.lsp.json` overrides extension config by server
  name.
- `LspServerManager.setServerConfigs()` currently clears all handles; it does
  not yet support incremental reconcile.
- The current repository has no shared pool path for LSP. Each session owns its
  own `NativeLspService` and subprocess/socket connections. The design should
  leave a boundary for a future shared pool, but v1 only implements
  single-session mode.

## Goals

Make LSP server configuration changes take effect without restarting the
current Qwen Code session:

- start a server when it is added;
- stop a server when it is removed, and remove it from status and tool routing;
- restart only the changed server when its config changes;
- keep unchanged servers connected and preserve their warm-up state;
- never start servers that are untrusted or not allowed;
- let LSP tools and `/lsp` status observe the new runtime state through the
  existing client object.

## Non-goals

- Do not add a shared LSP process pool in this change.
- Do not support toggling `--experimental-lsp` at runtime. If LSP was not
  enabled at startup, there is no service to reload.
- Do not fully watch extension install/uninstall changes that affect
  `lspServers`; manual `/reload` will cover extension config changes.

## Design

### 1. Identify Each LSP Server With a Stable Hash

Add a small helper near the LSP config code:

```ts
export function lspServerConfigHash(config: LspServerConfig): string;
```

The hash must be stable and based on the normalized runtime config produced by
`LspConfigLoader`:

- `name`
- `languages`
- `transport`
- `command`
- `args`
- `env`
- `initializationOptions`
- `settings`
- `extensionToLanguage`
- `workspaceFolder`
- `rootUri`
- `startupTimeout`
- `shutdownTimeout`
- `restartOnCrash`
- `maxRestarts`
- `trustRequired`
- `socket`

Object keys must be sorted so JSON property order does not cause unnecessary
restarts. Array order stays significant because command argument order and
language priority can be meaningful. Do not include runtime fields such as
process id, status, restart count, diagnostics, or warm-up state.

For future shared-pool compatibility, define the pool identity as:

```text
lsp:<workspaceRoot>:<serverName>:<configHash>
```

The v1 single-session manager only needs to maintain `serverName -> configHash`,
but the same hash can later be reused directly in the pool key.

### 2. Add Incremental Reconcile to `LspServerManager`

Hot reload should not reuse `setServerConfigs()`, which clears every handle.
Add:

```ts
async reconcileServerConfigs(
  configs: LspServerConfig[],
): Promise<LspReconcileResult>
```

Flow:

1. Build desired maps: `name -> config` and `name -> hash`.
2. For existing handles whose server no longer exists, call the existing
   `stopServer()`, then delete the handle.
3. For existing handles whose hash changed, call `stopServer()`, replace the
   handle with `{ config, status: 'NOT_STARTED' }`, then start it.
4. For new servers, create `{ config, status: 'NOT_STARTED' }` and start them.
5. For servers whose hash did not change, do nothing and keep the existing
   handle.

Add a private field:

```ts
private serverConfigHashes = new Map<string, string>();
```

Clear it in `stopAll()` and `clearServerHandles()`.

Return:

```ts
interface LspReconcileResult {
  added: string[];
  removed: string[];
  restarted: string[];
  unchanged: string[];
  failed: string[];
}
```

`skipped` is not part of the `LspServerManager` result. The manager only handles
configs that have passed admission; servers rejected by admission are aggregated
into the service-level result by `NativeLspService.reinitialize()`.

Concurrency:

- Add a reconcile queue in either `LspServerManager` or `NativeLspService` so
  reconciles run serially. Stopping and starting the same process must not race.
- If a new config arrives while a server is still starting, wait for
  `handle.startingPromise` before stopping it. Reuse the existing startup lock
  instead of adding an extra per-server lock.
- `stopServer()` itself must await `handle.startingPromise` after setting
  `stopRequested`, so `stopAll()`, remove, and restart paths all cover crash
  restarts that are still assigning their connection/process.

Failure behavior:

- If a newly added or changed server fails to start, keep the handle and mark it
  as `FAILED` so `/lsp` can explain the failure.
- Do not count a failed start as `added` or `restarted`; report it in
  `failed`.
- Do not cache the config hash for a failed start. A later save with the same
  config must retry instead of being classified as `unchanged`.
- If startup fails after a connection or process has been created, release that
  connection/process before returning. Failed initialization must not leave a
  language server process or socket connection alive behind a `FAILED` handle.
- If startup fails before connection creation, including trust rejection,
  unsafe command path, or missing command, clear the cached config hash. A later
  reconcile with the same config must retry instead of treating the failed
  handle as unchanged.
- If a removed server logs an error during shutdown, still delete it from the
  handle map.
- One server's startup failure must not block reconcile for other servers.

Resource cleanup:

- `stopServer()` must release both sides of an owned server: gracefully shut down
  and end the LSP connection, then kill the spawned process if it is still
  alive. This matters for `tcp`/`socket` transports that were launched with a
  `command`; closing the socket alone is not enough.
- `process.kill()` must be isolated with its own error handling. A process that
  exits during cleanup must not abort the rest of reconcile.
- Graceful shutdown must always have a bounded wait. If the server config does
  not specify `shutdownTimeout`, use the default shutdown timeout instead of
  awaiting `connection.shutdown()` forever.
- Shutdown timeout timers must be cleared when shutdown completes or fails so a
  large timeout does not retain the handle longer than necessary.
- The underlying `shutdown()` promise must be observed even when the timeout
  wins the race, so a late server-side rejection cannot surface as an
  unhandled rejection.
- `stopAll()` must participate in the same reconcile queue as hot reload. It is
  not enough to wait for the current queue and then iterate handles, because a
  new reconcile could otherwise enter between the wait and handle cleanup.
- `NativeLspService.stop()` must also cancel any in-flight or queued
  `reinitialize()` operation before stopping servers. The implementation uses
  cooperative cancellation with `AbortController`: stop marks the service as
  stopping, aborts the active reload, and every queued reload checks the signal
  before loading config, reconciling, clearing document tracking, replaying
  documents, or waiting on replay delays. This prevents shutdown from blocking
  indefinitely on a slow reload while also preventing a cancelled reload from
  starting new LSP processes after `stopAll()`.
- Crash restarts must also serialize through the reconcile queue, or clear the
  hash when they permanently fail. They must not start a replacement process in
  parallel with a config-change reconcile.
- Crash restart reset must isolate `connection.end()` and `process.kill()`
  errors. Reset runs when the old connection/process may already be broken, and
  cleanup failures must not prevent the queued restart from continuing.
- `NativeLspService.stop()` must clear `openedDocuments` and `lastConnections`
  after `serverManager.stopAll()` so a stopped service does not retain old
  document sets or connection objects.

### 3. Add `NativeLspService.reinitialize()`

Add:

```ts
async reinitialize(): Promise<LspServiceReinitializeResult>
```

Flow:

1. If `requireTrustedWorkspace` is true and `!config.isTrustedFolder()`, call
   `serverManager.stopAll()` and return. This prevents old LSP processes from
   continuing after the workspace becomes untrusted.
2. Use the existing `LspConfigLoader` to load the workspace `.lsp.json` and
   extension configs.
3. Merge configs using the current precedence.
4. Apply the LSP admission filter before reconcile.
5. Call `serverManager.reconcileServerConfigs(serverConfigs)`.
6. Clear `openedDocuments` and `lastConnections` only for removed and
   successfully restarted servers; preserve document state for unchanged and
   failed servers. Failed servers keep their document tracking so a later
   successful restart can replay the same open documents.
7. For successfully restarted servers, replay `textDocument/didOpen` for
   documents that were open before the restart. This gives the replacement
   server the same document context without waiting for the next hover,
   completion, or diagnostic request to lazily reopen each file. After replaying
   one or more documents for a server, wait for the same document-open delay
   used by lazy `ensureDocumentOpen()` before reporting reload completion.

The open-document snapshot must be taken after `reconcileServerConfigs()`
returns and must be scoped to `reconcile.restarted`. Documents opened while
reconcile is pending are then included in the replay snapshot before tracking is
cleared for restarted servers.

Initial discovery should use the same admission filter before calling
`setServerConfigs()`. This keeps startup and hot reload status consistent for
per-server `trustRequired` filtering in untrusted workspaces.

`.lsp.json` parse failures need special handling: do not treat parse failure as
empty config. The watcher should report an invalid-config event so the CLI can
show a user-visible error, but it must not call `reinitialize()` for that event.
`reinitialize()` should preserve the old runtime state, skip reconcile, and
write the error to status/logs. Only deleting the file, or parsing a valid empty
JSON config, means the desired config is empty.

Cold startup and hot reload intentionally use different user-config parsing
strictness:

- `loadUserConfigs()` stays lenient for startup compatibility. It skips invalid
  server entries and returns the valid entries that can be built.
- `loadUserConfigsStrict()` is used by hot reload. If the existing `.lsp.json`
  is syntactically valid but contains an invalid top-level shape or a server
  entry that cannot be built, it returns an error and `reinitialize()` does not
  reconcile. This preserves the currently running LSP state for invalid edits.
  The strict path must not introduce field-level validation that cold startup
  does not also enforce, because that would make a config valid at startup but
  invalid on the next save. Tightening known-field validation should be handled
  as a separate compatibility decision for both startup and hot reload. If the
  file is missing or is deleted during the strict load, treat that `ENOENT` as a
  valid empty user config, because deleting `.lsp.json` is the explicit way to
  remove all workspace user LSP servers.

`NativeLspService.reinitialize()` returns a service-level result:

```ts
interface LspServiceReinitializeResult {
  reconcile: LspReconcileResult;
  skipped: Array<{
    name: string;
    reason: 'server_trust_required';
  }>;
}
```

Add an optional `reinitialize()` method to `NativeLspClient` and delegate to the
service. To avoid opaque type assertions in `Config.reinitializeLsp()`, extend
the `LspClient` interface directly:

```ts
reinitialize?: () => Promise<LspServiceReinitializeResult>;
```

Add to `Config`:

```ts
async reinitializeLsp(): Promise<LspServiceReinitializeResult | undefined>
```

When LSP is disabled or no client exists, this is a no-op. This method must not
replace the client after `Config.initialize()`.

Because `setLspInitializationError()` currently rejects calls after
initialization, add a runtime-safe private state setter:

```ts
private setRuntimeLspInitializationError(error: Error | string | undefined): void
```

`reinitializeLsp()` uses it to expose reload failures through
`getLspStatusSnapshot()` without loosening the public post-init client mutation
API. A returned reconcile result with `failed` servers is a partial failure, not
a clean success. `reinitializeLsp()` must set `initializationError` for that
case and only clear the error when the reload has no failed servers.

### 4. Admission and Permission Boundary

Current LSP safety checks include:

- `--experimental-lsp` is the only enablement switch;
- workspace trust is checked before discovery/startup;
- each server's `trustRequired` defaults to true;
- command existence and command path safety are checked before spawn;
- `workspaceFolder` is constrained to the workspace root.

Hot reload must preserve these checks and complete them before starting a new
server or restarting a changed server. The key rule is: do not spawn first and
decide whether the server is allowed later.

Workspace `.lsp.json` is workspace-controlled input. User configs must
therefore always be treated as `trustRequired: true`, even if the file
explicitly declares `"trustRequired": false`. Extension-provided LSP configs may
still use their declared `trustRequired` value. This prevents an untrusted
workspace from lowering its own trust boundary.

Environment variables from `.lsp.json` are also workspace-controlled. Runtime
spawn may merge allowed env overrides, but code-injection variables such as
`NODE_OPTIONS`, `LD_PRELOAD`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, and
`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` must not be overridden by LSP config. `PATH` is allowed for
the actual server process to preserve common toolchain setups. Command
existence probing may keep regular config-provided env values that probes may
need, but it must not use config-provided `PATH` when resolving bare command
names. This prevents a malicious workspace `PATH` from redirecting a probe such
as `clangd --version` to an unintended executable before the real startup path.
Sensitive env key filtering, including the probe-only `PATH` filter, must be
case-insensitive so Windows-style case-insensitive environment names such as
`Path`, `node_options`, or `Ld_PreLoad` cannot bypass the denylist.

Allow-list boundary:

- The current repository does not support a CLI allow-list for LSP server names.
  I confirmed LSP only has `--experimental-lsp`; allow-list parameters are
  MCP-only.
- If this feature adds `--allowed-lsp-server-names`, it must behave like the MCP
  startup allow-list and act as an upper bound for the entire session lifetime.
  Runtime config may narrow this set, but it must not expand beyond the CLI
  startup upper bound.
- Store the startup upper bound in `ConfigParameters.lsp`:

```ts
cliAllowedLspServerNames?: string[];
```

Expose a getter for it. Do not read the upper bound from mutable settings.

Admission should be extracted into a pure function:

```ts
filterLspServerConfigs(configs, {
  workspaceTrusted,
  requireTrustedWorkspace,
  cliAllowedServerNames,
}): {
  admitted: LspServerConfig[];
  skipped: Array<{
    name: string;
    reason: 'server_trust_required';
  }>;
}
```

Even though there is no LSP approval store or CLI allow-list today, this helper
makes the security boundary explicit and leaves room for future hash-based
approval gates. If a future `--allowed-lsp-server-names` flag is added, it
should add a `not_allowed` skipped reason at that time instead of carrying an
unwired allow-list path in v1.

Trust semantics must match the current startup path:

- If `requireTrustedWorkspace` is true and the workspace is untrusted,
  `NativeLspService.reinitialize()` stops all servers at the service layer and
  returns. It does not enter the admission filter and does not preserve old
  servers.
- If `requireTrustedWorkspace` is false, the service does not short-circuit
  globally, but the admission filter still skips individual servers with
  `trustRequired: true`.
- If the workspace is trusted, `trustRequired` does not block the server.

### 5. Triggering

Two trigger paths are needed.

#### Automatic Workspace `.lsp.json` Trigger

Add a narrow `LspConfigWatcher` in the CLI, modeled after `SettingsWatcher` but
with a smaller responsibility:

- watch only the workspace root and strictly match basename `.lsp.json`;
- do not create any directory or file;
- debounce for 300 ms;
- compare `.lsp.json` before/after using parse + canonicalize so formatting-only
  changes do not trigger reload;
- treat `ENOENT` as deletion;
- distinguish JSON parse failures from other read failures. Both should notify
  the listener with a user-visible invalid-config event and preserve the old
  runtime state, but the error message must reflect whether the file was invalid
  JSON or unreadable;
- file deletion is a separate event and should notify the reload listener,
  producing empty workspace config;
- run callbacks serially;
- use listener timeout and failure isolation matching `SettingsWatcher`;
- advance the stored semantic snapshot only after listener notification succeeds.
  If the listener throws or times out, retain the previous snapshot so saving the
  same content again retries the reload.

Register the watcher only when `config.isLspEnabled()` and the client supports
`reinitialize()`. On change, call:

```ts
await config.reinitializeLsp();
```

Then emit an explicit runtime event such as `AppEvent.LspStatusChanged`.
UI surfaces such as `/lsp`, `/about`, or `/status` can subscribe to that event
to refresh. If reconcile returns partial failures, emit the status-changed event
before throwing back to the watcher; this lets the UI observe successfully
restarted servers while the watcher still retains the old semantic snapshot for
retry. On failure, also show a user-visible error through `AppEvent.LogError`;
include the underlying parser/startup error message when available, and do not
only write a debug log.

#### Manual `/reload` Trigger

When the future `/reload` command lands, it should call both:

```ts
await config.reinitializeMcpServers(...);
await config.reinitializeLsp();
```

Manual reload also provides the fallback path for extension `lspServers`
changes, because those changes may not map to a workspace `.lsp.json` file
event.

## Single Session and Shared Pool

Current state: only single-session mode exists. The repository has no LSP
equivalent of the MCP transport pool.

v1: implement incremental reconcile inside `LspServerManager`. Each session owns
its own process and socket.

Future shared pool: keep `NativeLspService` as the consumer and replace
`LspServerManager` internals with acquire/release of:

```text
lsp:<workspaceRoot>:<name>:<hash>
```

pool entries. Admission filtering must still happen before acquire, matching the
MCP shared-pool fix, so disallowed or untrusted servers cannot be started
through the pool path.

## Unit Test Plan

Prioritize unit tests. Integration tests against real LSP servers are slow and
environment-dependent, so they are not required.

### Core Tests

`packages/core/src/lsp/configHash.test.ts`

- hash ignores object key order;
- changes to command, args order, env, settings, workspace folder, socket, and
  trust requirement change the hash;
- hash excludes status/process/runtime fields.

`packages/core/src/lsp/LspServerManager.test.ts`

- adding a server starts it exactly once;
- removing a server shuts it down and deletes it from handles;
- hash changes stop the old handle and start a new handle;
- unchanged hash does not stop/start and preserves handle identity;
- startup failure after connection creation releases the connection and owned
  process;
- stopping a `tcp`/`socket` server launched by `command` closes the connection
  and kills the owned process;
- shutdown timeout timers are cleared when shutdown completes first;
- missing `shutdownTimeout` still uses the default shutdown timeout and cannot
  block reconcile forever;
- `stopAll()` waits for in-flight startup before releasing resources;
- `stopAll()` is serialized through the reconcile queue and cannot run
  concurrently with a later reconcile;
- `process.kill()` errors are logged and do not abort cleanup;
- one server startup failure does not affect another server's reconcile;
- concurrent reconciles run serially;
- `stopAll()` and `clearServerHandles()` clear the hash map;
- failed starts are reported in `failed`, are not reported as added/restarted,
  and do not cache their config hash;
- initial startup failures clear the cached hash so a later reconcile with the
  same config retries;
- crash restarts serialize with reconcile and clear cached hashes on permanent
  failure;
- crash restart reset ignores connection/process cleanup errors and continues
  the queued restart;
- command existence probing keeps regular config-provided env values, but does
  not use config-provided `PATH`, and code-injection env overrides are filtered
  before spawn;
- reconcile return value contains added/removed/restarted/unchanged/failed, not
  admission skipped.

Mock `createLspConnection`, initialization, and shutdown in tests. Do not start
real language servers.

`packages/core/src/lsp/NativeLspService.test.ts`

- `reinitialize()` loads workspace and extension config and passes merged config
  to manager reconcile;
- `.lsp.json` parse failure preserves old runtime state and does not call
  manager reconcile;
- strict hot reload rejects invalid top-level shapes and server entries that
  cannot be built without reconciling, while cold startup keeps loading valid
  entries from the same file;
- deleting `.lsp.json` treats workspace config as empty and triggers reconcile;
- strict loading treats `ENOENT` as an empty user config, including the
  deletion race where the file disappears between watcher notification and
  reload;
- untrusted workspace stops all servers and does not reconcile/start;
- initial discovery applies the same per-server `trustRequired` admission filter
  as hot reload;
- workspace `.lsp.json` cannot opt out of `trustRequired`;
- if a CLI allow-list is implemented, the upper bound filters admitted configs;
- service-level return value aggregates admission skipped reasons;
- restarted/removed servers only clear their own document tracking.
- failed servers do not clear document tracking and can replay those documents
  after a later successful restart.
- restarted servers replay `textDocument/didOpen` for previously opened
  documents after the replacement server is ready, then wait for the
  document-open processing delay.
- documents opened while reconcile is pending are included in the replay
  snapshot for restarted servers.
- `stop()` cancels in-flight replay delay and queued `reinitialize()` calls
  before they can start new servers.
- `stop()` clears document tracking caches after stopping all servers.

`packages/core/src/config/config.test.ts`

- `reinitializeLsp()` is a no-op when disabled or no client exists;
- when enabled and the client supports `reinitialize`, it delegates the call;
- when reinitialize throws, the status snapshot exposes the initialization/reload
  error.
- when reinitialize returns partial failures, the status snapshot exposes an
  initialization/reload error until a later fully successful reload clears it.

### CLI Tests

`packages/cli/src/config/lspConfigWatcher.test.ts`

- does not create `.lsp.json`;
- detects create/modify/delete;
- ignores unrelated files;
- ignores formatting-only changes after canonical parse;
- parse failure emits an invalid-config notification for user-visible feedback
  and does not trigger LSP reinitialization;
- non-ENOENT read failure emits a user-visible read-failure message and does not
  trigger LSP reinitialization;
- deleting `.lsp.json` triggers the reload listener;
- duplicate file events are debounced;
- slow listeners run serially;
- listener failure does not advance the stored snapshot and the same content can
  be retried by a later notification.

`packages/cli/src/ui/AppContainer.test.tsx` or the corresponding event test

- `AppEvent.LspStatusChanged` triggers UI refresh;
- reload failure emits a user-visible error through `AppEvent.LogError`.
- partial reconcile failure still emits `AppEvent.LspStatusChanged` before the
  listener rejects, so UI state can reflect successful parts of the reload.

`packages/cli/src/config/config.test.ts`

- preserve the existing assertion that `--experimental-lsp` constructs and
  starts native LSP;
- if `--allowed-lsp-server-names` is added, the parser supports comma-separated
  values and repeated flags, and stores them as the startup upper bound.

`packages/cli/src/ui/commands/lspCommand.test.ts`

- if `LspStatusSnapshot` exposes skipped reasons, status output can show
  skipped/disallowed servers.

Coverage goals: new pure functions should be near 100%; watcher branch coverage
should be comparable to `SettingsWatcher`; manager reconcile must cover
add/remove/change/unchanged/failure/concurrency.

## Strict Review

### Conclusion

1. **v1 should not use stop-all/start-all.**
   That implementation is simplest, but every save would restart unchanged
   language servers and lose warm state. The current manager already has
   per-server lifecycle methods, and incremental reconcile is a manageable
   amount of additional code.

2. **Do not put `.lsp.json` changes into `SettingsWatcher`.**
   `SettingsWatcher` is responsible for settings-scope reloads. Making it watch
   arbitrary workspace files would blur the contract and make MCP/settings
   behavior harder to reason about. A separate, narrow `.lsp.json` watcher is
   clearer.

3. **Do not replace `NativeLspClient` after initialization.**
   `Config.setLspClient()` explicitly forbids post-init mutation. Updating the
   service behind the adapter avoids expanding the lifecycle API.

4. **Admission must happen before process spawn or pool acquire.**
   This is the same risk called out in the MCP shared-pool design. Even though
   LSP has no pool today, service-level reload results should return pre-start
   filtering skipped reasons so a future pool path does not accidentally start a
   rejected server.

5. **A new LSP CLI allow-list is optional, but if added it must be an upper
   bound.**
   The current code has no LSP allow-list. The design must not allow settings to
   expand command-line restrictions at runtime, or it would be weaker than MCP
   hot-reload security semantics.

### Remaining Risks

- Extension `lspServers` may change without `.lsp.json` changing. The automatic
  watcher does not cover all extension filesystem changes; manual `/reload`
  covers that path.
- Some language servers do not tolerate rapid restarts well. Serialized
  reconcile and debounce reduce the risk, but tests should cover fast
  consecutive changes.
- TCP/socket servers may be externally managed daemons. Reconcile should close
  the connection, but it should only assume ownership of the process when this
  process spawned the server via `command`.
