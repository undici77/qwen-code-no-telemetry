# Goals

A Goal keeps Qwen Code working across turns until a stated condition is met. Set one with `/goal <objective>`; after each turn an independent verifier checks the transcript, and the session keeps going until the objective is verified complete, verified blocked, paused, or cleared.

## Commands

| Command                  | Behavior                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/goal`                  | Show the current Goal and its status.                         |
| `/goal <objective>`      | Create a Goal, or replace the active one.                     |
| `/goal set <objective>`  | Same as above, explicit form.                                 |
| `/goal edit <objective>` | Revise the active Goal's wording without starting over.       |
| `/goal pause` / `resume` | Stop or continue the loop without losing the Goal.            |
| `/goal clear`            | Remove the Goal.                                              |
| `/goal-draft <intent>`   | Have the objective written for you before you set it (below). |

Creating, editing, or resuming a Goal requires a trusted workspace (`/trust`). Headless usage is covered in [Headless Mode](./headless.md#run-a-persistent-goal).

## How a Goal is judged

The verifier never runs commands or reads files on its own. It only sees what is already in the transcript:

- Visible assistant output and tool results count as evidence. The objective text, your prompts, and the model's hidden reasoning do not.
- Printed text proves only that text was printed. A claim that tests pass, a file changed, or a remote is updated needs the corresponding tool result in the transcript.
- A claim that you confirmed, chose, or approved something needs a real message from you; the verifier rejects proposals that assume it.
- When evidence is missing the verdict is "not yet", not "done". A condition nobody can evidence keeps the loop running until a limit stops it.

So the objective has to make the agent produce evidence: run the named check and show the decisive output.

## Writing a good objective

Put these into the objective, in this order:

| Part         | What to write                                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Outcome:`   | One sentence: what is true when this is done.                                                                                         |
| `Done when:` | Numbered, binary checks. At least one names a command and its expected exit code or output line, and asks for that line to be pasted. |
| `Must not:`  | Files not to touch, tests or thresholds not to weaken, irreversible actions (push, delete, publish) not to take.                      |
| `Budget:`    | When to give up: "stop as blocked after 20 turns" or a time limit.                                                                    |
| `On block:`  | What to report when stuck, and which decision a human must make.                                                                      |
| `Context:`   | Only facts the agent cannot find in the workspace: branch, environment, earlier decisions.                                            |

Keep it to one objective and roughly under 1,200 characters. `/goal set` and `/goal edit` collapse newlines to spaces, so number the items rather than relying on line breaks.

| Weak                       | Why it fails                                                | Stronger                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| make checkout faster       | No threshold, no check.                                     | `Outcome: checkout p95 is below 250 ms. Done when: 1) npm run bench:checkout exits 0 and prints p95 < 250 (paste the line); 2) npm test exits 0. Must not: change the benchmark or skip tests. Budget: stop as blocked after 20 turns.` |
| clean up the auth module   | "Clean" has no evidence.                                    | Ask what would be observable: zero lint warnings in `src/auth`, a coverage threshold, a file count.                                                                                                                                     |
| ship the release           | Irreversible, and needs a human decision.                   | Narrow to a checkable pre-release state (tag exists, `npm run release:dry-run` exits 0) and put "do not publish" in `Must not`.                                                                                                         |
| after I confirm the design | The verifier cannot see a confirmation that never happened. | Move it to `On block:` as the decision a human must make.                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Let `/goal-draft` write it

`/goal-draft <what you want done>` is a bundled skill that does the above for you. It checks whether the request is a Goal at all, reads the workspace for the real test and lint commands instead of guessing, asks at most one round of multiple-choice questions when the answer changes the check or the scope, drafts the objective in the format above, runs the self-check, and prints a `/goal set …` line you can run as-is. It never starts the work itself and never sets the Goal on your behalf.

Pass an existing objective to tighten it: `/goal-draft all tests pass and the lint is clean`.

The skill is instructed to be read-only, and only its non-mutating tools are auto-approved (`get_goal`, `read_file`, `glob`, `grep_search`). `ask_user_question` is deliberately not auto-approved, so its question dialog is shown before the skill drafts from your answers. Like other bundled skills, a project or personal skill named `goal-draft` overrides it, and `skills.disabled` can turn it off. See [Skills](./skills.md) for how bundled skills are discovered.
