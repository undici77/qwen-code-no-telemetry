# git error is not misreported as a discarded commit.

# this PR fixes. So it runs on EVERY path. The gate is shared with the
# issue-fix verify step (rationale + the generator crash guard live in
# the script); the write is on a tracked file compared by `git status`,
# not the commit-level no-op git-diff below, and it is restored on
# failure. On failure it writes outcome=failed and exits 1.
# Run the copy staged from the trusted base checkout: a PR branch
# that predates the script does not contain it (bash would exit 127
# and kill the gate with no outcome), and the gate logic must come

# skip package tests; legitimate no-match input already exits 0 empty.
