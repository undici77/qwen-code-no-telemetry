# Settings-schema freshness is a STRUCTURAL guard, checked BEFORE the

# write no-action.md, and without this the no-op path would report the
# feedback as evaluated (acted=false) while CI stays red — the exact bug
# this PR fixes. So it runs on EVERY path. The gate is shared with the
# issue-fix verify step (rationale + the generator crash guard live in
# the script); the write is on a tracked file compared by `git status`,
# not the commit-level no-op git-diff below, and it is restored on
# failure. On failure it writes outcome=failed and exits 1.
# Run the copy staged from the trusted base checkout: a PR branch
# that predates the script does not contain it (bash would exit 127
# and kill the gate with no outcome), and the gate logic must come
# from the trusted base, not the branch under verification.
