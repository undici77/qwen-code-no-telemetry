# Live-progress heartbeat for the autofix round status comment.
#
# A review-address round can run for hours (130-minute agent step, 330-
# minute job) while the PR's status comment stays frozen at "working" —
# a healthy long round and a dead one look identical on the PR page.
# 'Post autofix status comment' starts this script as a detached loop;
# every interval it re-PATCHes the SAME status comment with elapsed time
# and last agent activity, and 'Finalize autofix status comment' kills it
# before writing the terminal text. Full rationale → qwen-autofix.md#af-149.
#
# Subcommands:
#   body — print the full bilingual working-state comment body to stdout.
#          Used for the initial post AND by every loop tick, so the two
#          can never drift apart.
#   loop — sleep–compose–PATCH until killed or a self-exit bound trips.
#
# Environment (both): HB_ROUND (display round, already +1'd by the step),
# HB_CAP, HB_URL, HB_WORKDIR, HB_START_EPOCH; NOW_EPOCH overrides the
# clock for tests. loop additionally needs: HB_REPO, HB_COMMENT_ID,
# GITHUB_TOKEN for gh, and TRUSTED_PATH (the launcher's stage-time PATH
# capture the tick re-pins; a launch without it fails fast);
# HB_INTERVAL_SECONDS (default 600) and HB_MAX_AGE_SECONDS (default
# 20400) bound the pulse.
#
# Kill contract: the loop writes heartbeat.pid (diagnostics + its own
# self-exit check), checks heartbeat-stop, and exits on either signal or
# when its own age cap trips. The killers target the pid the launch
# recorded in EXPRESSION CONTEXT (steps.post_status.outputs.heartbeat_pid)
# — WORKDIR is sandbox-writable, so no WORKDIR file is ever read as a kill
# target — and kill the pid, its process group, AND its whole session:
# each tick's `timeout 60 gh` subtree runs in its OWN process group
# (coreutils timeout default) under the loop's setsid session, so a
# group/pid kill alone leaves it alive holding the PAT for up to 60s. The
# round's verification gate kills the loop before running any branch code
# on the host; finalize and the always() cleanup kill again. Every killer
# confirms the pid's LIFECYCLE before signaling: the launch also records
# the loop's start time (heartbeat_start_ticks), and a pid reused between
# launch and kill belongs to a different process — a killer signals only
# a pid whose /proc/<pid>/stat start time still matches the launch
# capture, and kills nothing otherwise (a dead pid has no stat and a
# reused one a different start time, so a failed check always means the
# loop is already gone). Each tick additionally stamps
# heartbeat-tick-inflight with its start epoch around its gh call and
# removes it after: finalize drains that stamp before its terminal PATCH,
# because killing the client cannot cancel a request the server already
# accepted.
#
# PAT note: the loop holds the bot PAT in its environment. Its lifetime is
# bounded to the sandboxed agent phase — the agent executes PR content only
# inside the docker sandbox there, so no fork code runs on the host beside
# this loop; the verification gate ends the loop BEFORE the first step that
# runs branch code on the host. Every gh call additionally runs under the
# af-112 hermetic pins (pinned GH_HOST, dropped GH_TOKEN/GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN,
# a GH_CONFIG_DIR minted fresh milliseconds before the call and removed right
# after — a long-lived minted dir under the same-UID-writable RUNNER_TEMP is
# plantable between calls, R11-1), so a transport reroute planted in the
# shared HOME's gh config cannot intercept the token. See af-149 for the trade.

# -e is deliberately absent: the (( ... < 0 )) clamp guards exit non-zero
# on a false test and are load-bearing here. pipefail matches the sibling
# scripts' house line.
