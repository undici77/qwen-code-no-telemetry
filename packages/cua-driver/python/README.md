# cua-driver Python SDK

Rust-backed Python SDK and bundled executable for
[Qwen Cua Driver](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/tree/main/packages/cua-driver).

## Product boundary

This package is for client applications importing Cua Driver as an SDK:

```python
from cua_driver import CuaDriver
```

It does not contain a Python MCP client. Agents already have runtime-neutral
MCP clients and should configure the bundled server directly:

```text
qwen-cua-driver mcp
```

The removed pre-release MCP facade used `CuaDriver.stdio()`,
`AsyncCuaDriver`, `*Args`, and transport classes. Application code imports the
typed Rust-backed SDK shown below; agent code supplies `qwen-cua-driver mcp` to its
agent SDK.

## Installation

Install and usage guidance lives in the
[Qwen Cua Driver README](../README.md).

The wheel contains generated UniFFI bindings, a platform-specific Rust SDK
library, and the `qwen-cua-driver` executable. `CuaDriver.create()` loads the runtime
in the importing process and does not require the executable or daemon.

## SDK example

```python
import asyncio

from cua_driver import (
    CaptureScope,
    CuaDriver,
    CursorReducedMotion,
    EndSessionInput,
    GetDesktopStateInput,
    SetAgentCursorThemeInput,
    StartSessionInput,
)

async def main() -> None:
    driver = CuaDriver.create()
    await driver.start_session(
        StartSessionInput(session="demo", capture_scope=CaptureScope.DESKTOP)
    )
    try:
        await driver.set_agent_cursor_theme(
            SetAgentCursorThemeInput(
                session="demo",
                theme_id="cua.default",
                reduced_motion=CursorReducedMotion.AUTO,
            )
        )
        desktop = await driver.get_desktop_state(
            GetDesktopStateInput(session="demo", screenshot_out_file=None)
        )
        print(desktop.images[0].mime_type)
    finally:
        await driver.end_session(EndSessionInput(session="demo"))
        await driver.shutdown()


asyncio.run(main())
```

SDK operations are asynchronous. Desktop calls return a typed `ToolResult` with
text, images, verification/error metadata, and `structured_json` / `raw_json`
for platform-extensible results. Session lifecycle calls return dedicated
generated records.

The agent cursor is session-owned. Its default theme and custom dotLottie
authoring workflow are documented in
[`docs/cursor-themes.md`](../docs/cursor-themes.md). Custom source is compiled
and installed with the local CLI; SDK and MCP tools select only an installed
theme ID. The built-in cursor shows the sanitized public session name in a
badge below the pointer.

## Authorization integrations

`standard` is promptless for normal automation. An application that needs to
authorize attachment to an existing logged-in Chromium profile can construct a
configured runtime with
`CuaDriver.create_configured_with_authorization_host(options, host)`.
Implement `DriverAuthorizationHost.authorize()` in trusted application code
and return the request's exact digest with `ALLOW`, `DENY`, or `CANCEL`.

`CuaDriver.create_configured_with_activity_observer(options, observer)` emits
content-free action, refusal, grant, and session events. The observer cannot
change authorization or tool results. Use
`create_configured_with_host_integrations` when the application needs both.

See the [embedding guide](../rust/Skills/cua-driver/EMBEDDING.md) for complete
examples and the callback trust rules.

`CuaDriver.connect(socket_path)` remains available while existing applications
migrate. It exposes the same methods over the installed daemon, but it does not
provide a second SDK contract.

`shutdown()` closes admission, waits for already admitted operations to finish,
and is idempotent. Calls started after shutdown fail with `DriverError.Shutdown`.
Destroying a binding handle releases native resources, but orderly applications
should still await `shutdown()`.

## Daemon-backed MCP host

Applications that must also expose MCP to an external agent can own a private
daemon child. The child provides a stable permission identity and session
lifetime for short-lived or external clients:

```python
import asyncio

from cua_driver import CuaDriver, EmbeddedCuaDriverHost, get_binary_path


async def main() -> None:
    host = EmbeddedCuaDriverHost(
        binary_path=str(get_binary_path()),
        host_bundle_id="com.example.your-app",
    )
    connection = await host.start()
    driver = CuaDriver.connect(connection.socket_path)
    try:
        # Application calls use driver. An agent runtime can launch
        # connection.mcp.command with connection.mcp.args and environment.
        print(await driver.metadata())
    finally:
        del driver
        await host.stop()


asyncio.run(main())
```

`start()` coalesces concurrent callers, `stop()` cancels startup and is
idempotent, and `restart()` returns a new generation/PID/endpoint. Destroy SDK
clients and MCP proxies before stopping or restarting, then reconnect from the
new connection. `wait_for_exit(connection.generation)` observes unexpected
termination. Dropping the host closes its parent-liveness pipe and kills the
child as a fallback, but orderly applications should still await `stop()`.

## Binary wrapper

The package also exposes the bundled executable:

```python
from cua_driver import get_binary_path, run_cua_driver

print(get_binary_path())
exit_code = run_cua_driver(["mcp"])
```
