# Windows Rust Runner

Canonical Windows Rust harness runner for an interactive user desktop.

Run from `packages/cua-driver` in an RDP or console session:

```powershell
.\tests\runners\windows\run-all.ps1
.\tests\runners\windows\run-all.ps1 -RequireGui
```

The runner builds repo-local Windows fixtures and runs the Rust unit and typed
harness matrix. It intentionally skips optional external-app suites such as
LibreOffice because those require extra software on the VM image.
