# Cursor gallery

Maintainer preview for the production `cua.default` renderer. Generated media
is built from `cursor-overlay` and is intentionally not committed.

From the repository root:

```bash
./packages/cua-driver/scripts/cursor-gallery.sh serve
./packages/cua-driver/scripts/cursor-gallery.sh export-docs
```

`serve` opens no browser and serves the gallery at `http://127.0.0.1:3001`.
`export-docs` requires Chrome, Node.js with WebSocket support, Python 3, and
ffmpeg. It regenerates the public documentation GIFs deterministically from the
same rendered frames.

The gallery starts with an interactive production cursor configurator covering
all twelve actions, optional `background` / `foreground` delivery, and optional
`ax` / `pixel` / `browser` / `desktop` targets. It then shows all fifteen badge
context states and the twelve isolated theme-owned action animations. Delivery
and target glyphs appear only in their authoritative runtime location inside
the badge.
