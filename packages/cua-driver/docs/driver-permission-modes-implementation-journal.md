# Driver Permission Modes Implementation Journal

> Contract update: the shipped canonical middle-mode name is `bounded`, with
> `autonomous` retained as a compatibility alias. The interactive CLI danger
> flag now selects `unrestricted` as well as acknowledging its risk; embedded
> and environment-driven launchers still provide mode and acknowledgement as
> two explicit values. Historical entries below use the names current when
> each implementation step was recorded.

## Status

- **Goal:** Implement the reviewed driver permission-mode and consent plan.
- **Branch:** `codex/cua-driver-permission-modes`
- **Frozen base:** `origin/main` at
  `767acf25f25ea668ffab428e4f2e8985896de98e`
- **Source version:** Cua Driver `0.9.1`
- **Umbrella issue:** [#2381](https://github.com/trycua/cua/issues/2381)
- **Plan:** [driver-permission-modes-and-consent-plan.md](driver-permission-modes-and-consent-plan.md)

This journal records exact-head implementation and validation evidence. A row
is not called supported until the named public interface, independent oracle,
and representative environment have passed on the same commit.

## Frozen delivery slices

1. Fail-closed policy startup and one canonical daemon authorization path.
2. Immutable permission modes, policy composition, risk metadata, and status.
3. Protected-host approval broker and generalized grants.
4. Persistent indicator, Stop/revoke, and existing-profile migration.
5. Autonomous manifests and explicit unrestricted startup.
6. Driver-wide capability adapters, documentation, and platform certification.

Each slice remains on this host-owned branch until it is independently tested
and can be split into a reviewable PR without losing dependency history.

## Execution log

### 2026-07-20 — orientation and baseline

- Fetched `origin/main`; local base and fetched main both resolve to
  `767acf25f25ea668ffab428e4f2e8985896de98e`.
- Preserved the previously reviewed, uncommitted plan and created
  `codex/cua-driver-permission-modes` from that exact commit.
- Confirmed the first P0 gap in production code: a configured missing policy
  path logs a warning and becomes `Ok(None)`, while daemon binding happens
  before policy validation.
- Confirmed policy checks are duplicated in core stdio MCP, daemon socket, and
  stdio proxy dispatch.
- Baseline commands passed:
  - `cargo test -p cua-driver-core policy --all-features` — 13 passed.
  - `cargo test -p cua-driver --bin cua-driver policy --all-features` — build
    passed; no matching binary tests.

### 2026-07-20 — containment and immutable startup modes

- Explicitly configured missing/invalid policy paths now fail before Unix or
  Windows daemon bind, and the stdio proxy validates before beginning MCP
  dispatch.
- Core stdio, direct daemon, and proxy paths use one canonical capability
  policy function; the daemon remains authoritative and the proxy is only an
  early-denial optimization.
- Added immutable startup modes (`standard`, `autonomous`, `unrestricted`),
  with `standard` as the default and a separately named danger acknowledgement
  required for `unrestricted`.
- Disabled the same-user-writable existing-profile artifact in production by
  default. Standard/autonomous now return `browser_consent_required`; the
  legacy path requires an explicit trusted-launcher compatibility flag.
- Added direct CLI/daemon adversarial coverage for a syntactically valid forged
  artifact and for unrestricted launch-time behavior.
- Verification passed:
  - `cargo test -p cua-driver-core policy --all-features` — 13 passed.
  - `cargo test -p cua-driver-core authorization --all-features` — 5 passed.
  - `cargo test -p cua-driver-core browser::v2_tests --all-features` — 29 passed.
  - `cargo test -p cua-driver --test permission_policy_startup_test --all-features`
    — 3 passed.
  - Both new `daemon_required_test` authorization cases passed individually.
  - `cargo test -p cua-driver --bin cua-driver cli::tests --all-features` —
    13 passed.
  - `cargo fmt --all -- --check` — passed.

### 2026-07-20 — protected-host contract spike

- Current Codex documentation exposes MCP elicitation/approval UX, optional
  automatic approval review, and desktop-host attestation on Codex's app-server
  protocol. It does not define a verifiable Cua MCP-server attestation that
  proves a human (rather than a hook/reviewer/client) accepted an elicitation.
- MCP 2025-11-25 likewise leaves the client interaction model open and warns
  servers not to trust unverified client-provided identity.
- Decision: generic `elicitation/create` remains untrusted. The broker will
  require a request-bound authenticated provider result and otherwise fail
  closed. No Codex or Claude collector will be advertised as protected until a
  concrete host contract can be verified end to end.
- The live repository already has a versioned dotted capability vocabulary in
  `tool.rs`. Risk metadata will extend that canonical map rather than create a
  competing manifest vocabulary.

### 2026-07-20 — modes, broker, grants, and bounded autonomy

- Added the reviewed R0 through R4 risk map to every advertised tool. Unknown
  tools fail closed. `browser_prepare.existing_profile` is the first active
  resource adapter; other tools are explicitly marked `metadata_only`.
- Added immutable managed and user policy layers with SHA-256 provenance and
  intersection semantics. Either explicitly configured invalid path now fails
  before the action socket binds.
- Added request-bound protected consent with daemon instance, nonce,
  generation, mode, policy hashes, exact sessions, resource, expiry, and digest.
  Generic MCP elicitation, files, TTY input, and tool arguments cannot implement
  the provider seam.
- Made indicator activation a prerequisite for protected grants. Stop, exact
  session teardown, expiry, reconnect exhaustion, and context drift revoke the
  grant and release its browser connection.
- Added `cua-driver revoke --session <id>` and `--all`, plus content-free mode,
  policy, provider, and manifest status.
- Added autonomous manifests with a 24-hour maximum, explicit launch approval,
  deny-by-default tool sets, exact existing-profile PID/window scope, requested
  origin checks, and live top-level origin checks before each browser mutation.
- Added unrestricted startup warnings and
  `CUA_DRIVER_DISABLE_UNRESTRICTED=1` for administrator disablement.
- Added a hard refusal for PID-targeted tools that name the authorization
  daemon itself.
- Updated generated CLI/MCP references, policy concepts and how-to pages,
  browser attachment docs, test matrix, and a new permission-mode reference.

Verification on the macOS source host:

- Core `policy`, `authorization`, `consent`, `session_manifest`, grant, session,
  refusal, and browser v2 suites passed in targeted runs.
- `permission_policy_startup_test`: 8 passed.
- `daemon_required_test`: 7 passed.
- CLI manifest/parser tests: 13 passed.
- `cargo test -p cua-driver-core --no-default-features authorization`: 8 passed.
- Generated documentation drift, public hygiene, and internal link checks
  passed.
- `cargo test --workspace --all-features` is not a valid all-host gate on
  macOS: Linux-only examples `libei_input` and `screenshot_cascade` compile
  against modules gated by `target_os=linux`. The failure occurred before test
  execution and is unrelated to this change. Package-scoped and target-native
  VM gates remain required.

### 2026-07-20 — independent Fable implementation review

- Claude Code Fable reviewed the uncommitted implementation against the plan
  and returned **SHIP AFTER FIXES** with no P0 findings.
- Closed every P1 finding before platform certification:
  - enforced a terminal autonomous idle timeout at canonical dispatch;
  - rejected origin-scoped manifests that also allow generic page/desktop
    input surfaces outside the typed live-origin adapter;
  - made the legacy artifact startup-invalid in autonomous and unrestricted
    modes, preserving the mandatory autonomous indicator;
  - extracted and directly tested the live-origin decision path used after
    `Page.getFrameTree` and before browser mutation.
- Closed the bounded P2 hardening items in the same pass: provider request and
  indicator deadlines, final expiry checks, provider identity in status,
  metadata-only old-daemon proxy fallback, change-during-load policy hashing,
  and explicit indicator-lease teardown semantics.
- Corrected documentation so `standard` describes only the currently active
  existing-profile prompt, and documented PID reuse, origin-adapter exclusions,
  terminal idle expiry, and restart-flag preservation.
- Post-review targeted gates passed:
  - session-manifest tests: 5 passed;
  - consent tests: 6 passed;
  - live-origin decision test: 1 passed;
  - `permission_policy_startup_test`: 9 passed.

### 2026-07-20 — exact-commit platform certification

All three installation lanes used source commit
`d29fd128f9b287198b3c595ebb987c9411c3af21` and Cua Driver version
`0.9.1`. Each installed daemon reported `standard` mode and
`protected consent collector: unavailable`; `get_config.source_sha` matched
the synced commit. This is the intended fail-closed standalone posture, not a
claim that a protected host provider ships in this slice.

- macOS 26.5.2 arm64, disposable Lume Aqua VM
  `cua-permission-modes-d29fd128f`:
  - installed `/Applications/CuaDriver.app` with the repository's stable
    signing identity and visible CLI `/Users/lume/.local/bin/cua-driver`;
  - installed binary SHA-256
    `fef4ca7e1574678f55ca7226e93667f0f05046f6234bdd4690bcfed89d131c3d`;
  - `permission_policy_startup_test`: 9 passed in release mode;
  - `daemon_required_test`: 7 passed in release mode.
- Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64, Azure VM `cua-linux-071`:
  - installed binary
    `/home/azureuser/.cua-driver/packages/releases/0.0.0-local-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/cua-driver`;
  - installed binary SHA-256
    `0aa9f19eb0bb58e781fcdaf52a4d8c3c9aa56ca660132da4fad3390a4ef7e7be`;
  - `permission_policy_startup_test`: 9 passed in release mode;
  - `daemon_required_test`: 7 passed in release mode;
  - the documented installer migration permanently swept the test VM's legacy
    `/home/azureuser/.cua-driver-rs` directory after preserving telemetry.
- Windows x86_64, Azure VM `cua-win-071`:
  - established an RDP desktop with FreeRDP after independently matching its
    TLS certificate SHA-256 to the certificate read over the trusted SSH
    channel;
  - ran the install and certification harness as `azureuser` in active RDP
    session 4, with Explorer also in session 4; Session 0 was rejected by the
    harness;
  - installed binary
    `C:\Users\azureuser\AppData\Local\Programs\Cua\cua-driver\bin\cua-driver.exe`;
  - installed binary SHA-256
    `8b3d58eb0f693f8a2eec1fed52fd2ab447419c5b165c675719e7bdcbd4550ba8`;
  - `permission_policy_startup_test`: 9 passed in release mode;
  - `daemon_required_test`: 7 passed in release mode;
  - removed the temporary interactive scheduled certification task after the
    structured result reported success.

## Current work

Implementation, review fixes, documentation, and exact-commit platform
certification are complete. The remaining delivery work is to publish the
branch, open the review PR, update umbrella issue #2381, and monitor repository
checks. No standalone host is advertised as a certified protected provider;
standard/autonomous existing-profile attachment remains fail closed.
