# Rust E2E CI Reporting

Rust owns behavioral case declarations, observations, result classification,
and report validation. OS runners build the environment, execute Rust targets,
and upload the validated artifacts.

## Canonical Invocation

The contributor-facing invocation runs the complete matrix on every OS and
takes no suite selector:

```text
Windows: scripts/ci/windows/run-rust-e2e.ps1 -RequireGui
Linux:   scripts/ci/linux/run-rust-e2e.sh
macOS:   packages/cua-driver/tests/runners/macos-lume/run-all.sh
```

Automated workflows may set a private lane value to fan that matrix into
shared, native, and capture jobs so one failure does not hide another lane.
The maintainer-run macOS Lume gate runs the complete matrix by default. These
are execution partitions, not public suite choices or separate behavioral
sources of truth.

## Execution Order

Each runner follows the same sequence:

1. Resolve one immutable source SHA and check out that SHA in every lane.
2. Build the Rust driver and required repo-local fixtures.
3. Run `e2e_environment_preflight_test` once; it verifies `git rev-parse HEAD`
   or the VM source marker against the resolved SHA. On macOS it also verifies
   that the installed, TCC-authorized daemon embeds that exact SHA.
4. Abort before behavioral cells if the desktop, permissions, fixture, capture,
   or video lifecycle is unavailable.
5. Run the selected Rust integration targets.
6. Validate declarations, results, and evidence with `cua-e2e-report`.
7. Upload or retrieve the report, logs, and recordings.

The preflight prevents a single TCC or desktop-session problem from appearing
as the same failure on every behavioral cell.

## Artifact Files

Each OS lane writes:

```text
artifacts/cua-driver/<platform>/
|-- environment.jsonl
|-- cases.jsonl
|-- results.jsonl
|-- summary.md
|-- environment-preflight.log
|-- <rust-target>.log
`-- recordings/<cell-label>-pid<process>-<sequence>/
    |-- recording.mp4
    |-- trajectory.json
    |-- session.json
    |-- cursor.jsonl
    `-- turn-*/
        |-- action.json
        |-- evidence.json
        |-- before_state.json
        |-- before.png
        |-- after_state.json
        |-- after.png
        |-- app_state.json
        |-- screenshot.png
        `-- click.png (dispatched click-family turns)
```

`cases.jsonl` is the executed catalog. `results.jsonl` contains one result for
every declared cell. In canonical mode, the reporter rejects duplicates,
missing results, undeclared results, contradictory statuses, forbidden skips,
an under-sized unfiltered shared catalog, missing required videos, and missing
or invalid expected turn evidence. Canonical runners set
`CUA_E2E_FORBID_SKIPS=1` and `CUA_E2E_EXPECTED_MIN_CELLS` (80 on
Windows/Linux, 120 on macOS). Explicit diagnostic filters omit only the
minimum-count policy; a filter matching zero cells still fails in Rust. An `evidence.json`
classification normally makes capture failure auditable without making it
pass. The one narrow exception is a successful Windows `bring_to_front`
restoration:
the before image may be `target_minimized`, and the after image may be
`capture_failed`, only when the action reports success, after-state
accessibility data was captured, and the required trajectory and finalized MP4
remain present. Any
other missing image still fails closed.

A click-family call refused before its target can be resolved is the other
explicit non-capture case: `action.json` records `result_error: true` without a
`click_point`, and `evidence.json` records the click phase as
`not_applicable/action_refused_before_target_resolution`. No input was aimed or
dispatched, so that turn must not invent a `click.png`; successful and
target-resolved click-family turns still require it.

The testkit prepares each cell's artifact directory before fixture setup but
does not start `recording.mp4` yet. On Windows GitHub-hosted runners it obtains
the test process's inherited top-level console with `GetConsoleWindow`, verifies
the HostedComputeAgent/runner title and console class, then minimizes it with
`ShowWindow(SW_MINIMIZE)`. Fixture readiness
and the required foreground or sentinel-occluded posture are established after
that cleanup. The cell then calls `start_behavior_recording`, re-establishes
the sentinel posture after the capture backend attaches, and clears setup-only
focus events. It dispatches the action only after this observation boundary,
then keeps recording through oracle collection.

`trajectory.json` records the behavioral video phase as `pending`, `started`,
or `finalized`, its start/baseline/finalization timestamps, and the hosted-runner
console cleanup status. Strict reporting
requires `finalized`. A setup or posture failure before the boundary remains in
the test result and logs, and the testkit writes `recording-error.txt`; it does
not create a misleading behavioral clip.

## Environment Record

The preflight emits exactly one record:

```json
{
  "schema": "cua-e2e-environment/v2",
  "platform": "macos",
  "display_server": "quartz",
  "source_sha": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567",
  "status": "ready",
  "duration_ms": 912,
  "message": ""
}
```

An error record produces an environment section in `summary.md` and aborts the
lane before case declarations are executed. The same source SHA appears in the
successful typed summary.

## Case And Result Contract

A case declaration uses `cua-e2e-case/v2`. A result flattens the same contract
fields into `cua-e2e-result/v2` and adds the observation:

```json
{
  "schema": "cua-e2e-result/v2",
  "cell_id": "windows-tauri-left-click-ax-background",
  "platform": "windows",
  "display_server": "win32",
  "harness": "tauri",
  "toolkit": "platform-webview",
  "action": "left_click",
  "targeting": "ax",
  "delivery": "background",
  "scope": "window",
  "driver_route": "uia_invoke",
  "expected_behavior": { "kind": "deliver" },
  "oracles": ["fixture_state", "focus", "z_order", "no_leaked_input", "cursor"],
  "test_status": "pass",
  "observed_behavior": "delivered",
  "passed_oracles": ["fixture_state", "focus", "z_order", "no_leaked_input", "cursor"],
  "duration_ms": 1482,
  "message": "",
  "evidence": {
    "video": "recordings/windows-tauri-left-click-ax-background-pid123-001/recording.mp4",
    "trajectory": "recordings/windows-tauri-left-click-ax-background-pid123-001/trajectory.json"
  }
}
```

`targeting` describes how the action identifies its target: `ax`, `px`,
`page`, or `not_applicable`. It is separate from screenshot/tree capture.

## Classification Rules

`test_status` answers whether the cell met its declared contract.
`observed_behavior` records what the driver did.

| Expected | Observed | Required oracles | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deliver | Delivered | Passed | Pass |
| Deliver | Refused | Any | Fail |
| Deliver | No effect or error | Any | Fail |
| Refuse | Allowed structured refusal | Passed | Pass |
| Refuse | Different refusal code | Any | Fail |
| Refuse | Delivered | Any | Fail pending contract review |

The structured refusal enum currently recognizes
`background_unavailable`, `background_occluded`, and
`background_uipi_blocked`. Each refusal case declares the exact subset allowed
by its controlled setup. String-prefix or message-substring matching is not
accepted.

A refusal contract also requires focus, z-order, and leaked-input observations.
An honest refusal does not satisfy a case whose contract requires delivery.

## Summary Ownership

`cua-e2e-report` is the only behavioral Markdown renderer. Shell and
PowerShell runners must not parse `test ... ok` output or create `host=cargo`
and `host=lane` rows. Cargo logs remain available for unit-test annotations and
lane diagnostics, outside the behavioral population.

The summary reports delivered passes, refused passes, failures, and skips
separately. Shared and native targets emit the same typed records; a compile or
runner failure that prevents declaration remains visible as a failed job and
cannot be mistaken for a green behavioral row.

## Evidence Links

Every canonical behavioral cell records a validated MP4 and trajectory. The
recording directory also contains its session metadata and turn-level action
and screenshot files; Cargo target logs remain lane-level diagnostics. GitHub
cannot deep-link to a file inside a multi-cell artifact archive, so each summary
row displays the exact MP4 path as a link to the owning lane archive while the
trajectory rollup provides bulk-download links and video counts.
