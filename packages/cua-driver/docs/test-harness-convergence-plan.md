# Rust E2E Harness Convergence Plan

**Historical plan.** Use `test-harnesses-guide.md`, `test-matrix.md`, and
`e2e-ci-reporting.md` for the implemented contributor workflow.

## Re-review Verdict

The original direction remains sound:

- Rust owns scenarios, assertions, and result records.
- Repo-local harness applications are the canonical E2E targets.
- AX/PX targeting and foreground/background delivery are dimensions on an
  action. They are not test families.
- Focus, z-order, cursor, and desktop checks are cross-cutting observations.
- The selector-free contributor invocation runs the complete matrix on every
  OS. CI may fan it into internal jobs for failure isolation.

This review changes five parts of the earlier plan:

1. Do not make a historical cell count a target. The shared matrix must cover
   supported route combinations, while every omission needs a route
   equivalence or unsupported-capability reason.
2. Separate test status from driver behavior. A test may pass because a
   required action was delivered or because a declared unsupported route was
   refused correctly. Those outcomes must remain distinct in reports.
3. Treat environment readiness as a lane preflight. A missing desktop, TCC
   grant, fixture, AT-SPI bus, recorder, or interactive Windows session must
   fail once before behavioral cells run.
4. Use a typed Rust case catalog as the matrix source. Do not add a second
   `matrix.yaml`, Python collector, or shell-owned scenario list.
5. Preserve one evidence bundle per cell, but reuse the driver and harness
   process where explicit state reset proves isolation.

The target is a smaller set of tests with named coverage reasons and strong
external oracles. Test count is not a success metric.

## Non-negotiable Rules

1. A successful tool response never proves delivery. A delivered action must
   change fixture or desktop state that the test reads independently.
2. A background action must also prove that it did not steal focus, raise the
   target, move the real cursor, or leak partial input when those invariants
   apply.
3. A refusal is valid only when the cell contract expects refusal, the driver
   returns an allowed structured refusal code, and the desktop observer sees no
   side effect.
4. A cell that requires delivery fails when the driver refuses, even if the
   refusal is honest.
5. A required canonical fixture or desktop capability cannot become a passing
   early return. Optional tests must be declared optional before execution.
6. Known gaps do not use `#[should_panic]` and do not count as green coverage.
   They run in a named optional lane with a linked issue until fixed.
7. Shell and PowerShell runners build the environment and collect artifacts.
   They do not infer behavioral results from Cargo output.
8. The Rust source build under test must be recorded in every run. macOS may
   proxy through the installed app bundle for TCC, but that bundle must come
   from the same source revision.

## Current Branch State

The branch implements the target ownership and reporting model. Platform
validation below replaces the older 60-cell proposal and records the remaining
environment or backend gaps separately.

### Implemented

- `cross_platform_behavior_test.rs` has one typed 40-cell catalog per shared
  harness application: 80 shared cells across Electron and Tauri per platform.
  It covers AX and PX with foreground and background delivery for click,
  text, keyboard, scroll, and child-window actions; PX drag and AX editor-save
  each cover both delivery modes.
- Declaration and result schema v2 record action, `targeting`, delivery, scope,
  backend route, expected and observed behavior, independent test status,
  required oracles, duration, and evidence.
- Background refusal matching uses the explicit structured set:
  `background_unavailable`, `background_occluded`, and
  `background_uipi_blocked`.
- Every catalog route is explicit for Win32, Quartz, X11, and Wayland. Windows
  Chromium PX background keeps its targeted-injection route metadata, while a
  fully occluded target expects the exact `background_occluded` refusal because
  temporarily raising the window would violate the desktop-side-effect contract.
- Every background shared cell attaches independent focus, z-order,
  leaked-input, and fixture-state observations. Windows, macOS, and X11 also
  attach the real-cursor observer. An occluding Electron sentinel supplies the
  focus and leaked-input journal across target frameworks. Wayland leaves the
  cursor oracle explicitly unsupported while issue #2194 investigates a
  capability-checked observer.
- Electron and Tauri use repo-local builds of the same shared web fixture.
- Windows, Linux, and macOS runners have strict source, fixture, AX, capture,
  and video preflights. Shell runners no longer synthesize behavioral rows.
- Rust validates duplicate, missing, contradictory, and evidence-less results
  before rendering the GitHub summary.
- Per-cell source-driver recording support exists in `cua-driver-testkit`.
- The typed catalog is the sole shared behavior owner; the three older shared
  tests and duplicate guard/modality targets were removed after their unique
  assertions moved to typed shared, native, launch, capture, cursor, and
  desktop-scope rows.
- WPF, WinUI3, WebView2, AppKit, SwiftUI, GTK3, capture, launch, cursor, and
  desktop-scope owners emit the same typed result records as the shared matrix.

### Execution record

The plan reached its ownership and reporting target on 2026-07-12. Current
support details remain in `action-support.md`; these landing checkpoints record
completion without turning this historical plan into a live status page.

- Windows run `29211506624` passed 114/114 rows at `6d7f02e4`.
- The logged-in macOS matrix passed 133/133 rows at `448d052f` with the stable
  installed-app TCC identity.
- Linux X11 run `29213365684` and Sway run `29213349962` each passed 108/108
  rows at `72083bb4`, with the same 71 deliveries and 37 exact refusals.
- The optional nested `cua-compositor` lane remains experimental and reports
  its typed failures rather than contributing stock-Wayland support claims.
- Some native targets still use fixed waits; shared and Windows web targets
  poll external state and allocate CDP ports per process.

## Target Test Model

### Typed case catalog

Every behavioral cell is declared in Rust with one structure shared by web and
native harness tests:

```rust
struct CaseSpec {
    id: &'static str,
    platform: Platform,
    display_server: DisplayServer,
    harness: Harness,
    action: Action,
    targeting: Targeting,
    delivery: Delivery,
    scope: Scope,
    expectation: ContractExpectation,
    oracles: &'static [OracleKind],
    route: DriverRoute,
}

enum ContractExpectation {
    Deliver,
    Refuse { allowed_codes: &'static [RefusalCode] },
}
```

`RefusalCode` is an enum, not a string-prefix check. Its initial Windows set is
`BackgroundUnavailable`, `BackgroundOccluded`, and `BackgroundUipiBlocked`;
Linux currently declares only `BackgroundUnavailable`. A cell lists the exact
codes allowed by its controlled setup.

`Targeting` uses `Ax`, `Px`, `Page`, or `NotApplicable`. Use `targeting` in the
schema instead of `capture_mode`; capture is a separate read contract.

`DriverRoute` names the implementation path that justifies coverage, such as
UIA Invoke, PostMessage, coordinate injection, CGEvent, AT-SPI action, libei,
or CDP. It is test metadata, not a request parameter.

The catalog is the machine-readable inventory. Contributor documentation and
the coverage table are generated from it or checked against it. There is no
second matrix file to keep in sync.

### Result record

Use one schema version and these independent fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `cell_id` | Stable case id |
| `platform`, `display_server` | OS and Win32/Quartz/X11/Wayland environment |
| `harness`, `toolkit` | Electron, Tauri, WPF, WinUI3, WebView2, AppKit, SwiftUI, GTK3 |
| `action`, `targeting`, `delivery`, `scope` | Contract dimensions |
| `driver_route` | Backend path covered by the cell |
| `expected_behavior` | `DELIVER` or `REFUSE` |
| `test_status` | `PASS`, `FAIL`, `SKIP`, or `ENVIRONMENT_ERROR` |
| `observed_behavior` | `DELIVERED`, `REFUSED`, `NO_EFFECT`, `ERROR`, or `NOT_RUN` |
| `refusal_code` | Structured code when observed behavior is `REFUSED` |
| `oracles` | App state and attached desktop observations |
| `known_issue` | Optional issue id; it never changes a failure to a pass |
| `evidence` | Video, trajectory, screenshots, structured state, and log paths |

This removes the ambiguous `EXPECTED_REFUSAL` status. A refusal contract passes
only when `expected_behavior=REFUSE`, `observed_behavior=REFUSED`, the code is
allowed, and all no-side-effect oracles pass. Reports count delivered and
refused passes separately.

### Coverage selection

Do not restore the full Cartesian product automatically. Select cells by
driver route:

1. Every supported action has foreground and background coverage when the tool
   exposes both delivery modes.
2. Every distinct targeting path used by that action has at least one cell.
3. Every distinct OS backend route has at least one cell.
4. Renderer or toolkit duplication is kept only when it changes the route or
   has produced a real compatibility defect.
5. Every omitted combination names an `equivalent_to` cell or an unsupported
   contract reason.

The shared catalog currently declares 40 cells per harness application, or 80
cells across Electron and Tauri per platform. Add a missing combination when it
reaches a different driver route. Remove a combination only when another cell
proves the same route with an equal or stronger oracle.

## Cross-cutting Desktop Observer

Add one testkit interface that snapshots desktop state before and after an
operation:

```text
DesktopObservation
  foreground window
  target z-order and minimized state
  focus-change journal
  real cursor position
  optional leaked-input journal
```

The testkit `DesktopObserver` provides this interface with native Windows,
macOS, and Linux backends.

Attach the observer to:

- every background delivery cell;
- refusal cells;
- launch/minimize cells;
- screenshot and capture cells that promise no focus change;
- cursor evidence cells.

For successful background delivery, the cell requires both target-state change
and unchanged desktop invariants. For refusal, the cell requires no target
change and unchanged desktop invariants. A focus-only pass never proves input
delivery.

## Process And Evidence Lifecycle

Use these boundaries:

- one Rust source build per lane;
- one driver daemon or MCP process per lane;
- one harness process per harness group when the fixture has a verified reset
  operation;
- one recording session and result record per cell;
- a harness restart after crash, reset failure, or window identity change.

Each fixture reset must return a generation token. The next cell verifies the
new token and clean marker state before acting. Until a harness has this reset
contract, keep process-per-cell isolation.

Video remains required for every canonical E2E cell. Test video capture once in
the lane preflight. A recorder failure aborts the lane before the case catalog
runs, rather than generating the same permission failure for every cell.

## Environment Preflight

Each OS runner performs one preflight and emits one environment record.

Common checks:

- source revision and driver version match;
- required fixture binaries exist;
- the display/user session is interactive;
- the driver can list and inspect a preflight fixture;
- accessibility and capture permissions work;
- a short video starts, stops, and passes `ffprobe`;
- artifact directories are writable.

Platform checks:

| Platform | Required preflight |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | Non-Session-0 interactive desktop, input desktop, foreground sentinel, FFmpeg, UIA visibility |
| macOS | App-bundle daemon identity, live socket, Accessibility, Screen Recording, fixture window visibility |
| Linux X11 | X server, DBus, AT-SPI, window manager, capture, input backend |
| Linux Wayland | Compositor, DBus, AT-SPI, portal/capture path, libei or declared refusal path |

Canonical invocations set strict mode. Missing required capabilities produce
`ENVIRONMENT_ERROR`; they never return from a test as a pass.

## File Ownership And Disposition

| Current file | Final owner or action |
| --- | --- |
| `cross_platform_behavior_test.rs` | Shared Electron/Tauri case catalog and external fixture-state and desktop-side-effect oracles |
| `harness_wpf_test.rs` | WPF-specific rows using the common case/result runner |
| `harness_winui3_test.rs` | WinUI3-specific rows; keep only toolkit-distinct behavior |
| `harness_web_test.rs` | WebView2 and Page/CDP behavior; do not mix Page targeting with AX/PX labels |
| `harness_appkit_test.rs` | Canonical AppKit rows, including foreground/background AX scroll and the exact PX background-drag refusal |
| `harness_swiftui_test.rs` | Canonical SwiftUI tree/capture, background action, and popover-trigger rows; transient-panel enumeration remains a separate gap |
| `harness_gtk3_test.rs` | Minimal GTK3/AT-SPI rows for X11 and Wayland |
| Legacy Windows UX guard target | Deleted after typed launch, cursor, shared, capture, and desktop-scope owners passed the replacement audit |
| `modality_input_e2e_test.rs` | Deleted; shared cells own web actions and the Notepad row had no delivery oracle |
| `modality_background_test.rs` | Deleted; typed WPF background action rows and capture ownership passed the replacement audit |
| `capture_contract_test.rs` | Sole owner for tree/image inclusion behavior; canonical prerequisites fail instead of skipping |
| `desktop_scope_<os>_test.rs` | Platform-specific window/desktop scope contracts |
| `modality_focus_test.rs` | Deleted; shared click/type cells own focus preservation and launch focus has its typed action owner |
| `installed_app_launch_macos_test.rs` | Supporting typed Calculator/TextEdit launch and focus rows in the canonical logged-in macOS lane |
| `installed_app_textedit_macos_test.rs` | Supporting typed TextEdit AX integration in the canonical logged-in macOS lane; schema assertions remain in protocol tests |
| `harness_libreoffice_test.rs` | Optional installed-app lane; exclude from the canonical run and counts |
| `protocol_*`, schema, transport tests | Unit/protocol gate; no desktop video and no behavioral matrix rows |
| `tests/fixtures/shared/scenarios.json` | Prune only after selector and marker-reference audit |

## CI Shape

The contributor invocation stays selector-free. Lane selection remains private
CI plumbing and diagnostic state.

### Pull requests

- Run unit/protocol jobs by affected OS paths.
- Shared core or schema changes trigger Linux and Windows unit jobs.
- Platform-only changes trigger that platform's unit job.
- E2E is maintainer-dispatched and may become an optional pre-merge gate.

### Maintainer E2E

- Windows GitHub-hosted runners are canonical when the preflight proves an
  interactive desktop. An Azure RDP runner is an optional environment-parity
  replay, not a second source of behavioral truth.
- Linux GitHub-hosted runners run X11 under Xvfb with hosted packages. The Nix
  source gate is separate; the pure-Wayland maintainer lane uses the Nix dev
  shell. Linux produces no GIF requirement.
- macOS runs on a logged-in, TCC-authorized host through the canonical macOS
  runner. A future self-hosted runner must use the same preflight.

CI may fan the complete matrix into shared, native, and capture/scope jobs.
Those are execution partitions, not alternate public test suites.

## Reporting And Evidence

Rust emits one record for every declared cell. A shared Rust reporter then:

1. rejects duplicate or missing cell ids;
2. verifies the result against the case contract;
3. verifies required video evidence exists and is non-empty;
4. renders the behavioral table and the declared coverage table;
5. fails when a declared cell produced no result.

Do not parse `test ... ok` lines to create behavioral rows. Cargo/JUnit output
may still provide failure annotations for unit tests.

Upload one artifact archive per internal lane, with one stable evidence
subdirectory per behavioral cell. Each GitHub summary row links its exact
video path text to the owning lane archive. The adjacent `trajectory.json`
path remains in `results.jsonl` and the archive. GitHub cannot deep-link to a
file inside an archive; the exact path keeps the row unambiguous without
multiplying artifact uploads by the cell count.

## Implementation Slices

### Slice 1: Contract and preflight

- Finalize `CaseSpec`, result enums, refusal-code enums, and one schema version.
- Add reporter validation for duplicate, missing, and contradictory records.
- Add strict environment preflight to Windows, Linux, and macOS runners.
- Stop shell runners from inventing behavioral rows.

Exit: a missing session, fixture, permission, or recorder fails once as an
environment error, and a synthetic CaseSpec set renders a valid report.

### Slice 2: Shared matrix integrity

- Map every shared cell to an explicit driver route.
- Add any missing route cells; document every omitted equivalent.
- Add the desktop observer to background and refusal cells.
- Preserve editor-save and all existing external markers.
- Remove the three legacy shared tests after mapping every assertion.

Exit: no fake drag pass, no arbitrary error accepted as refusal, no shared
legacy test, and one result/evidence bundle per shared cell. This source
convergence is complete; platform delivery defects remain visible as cell
failures.

### Slice 3: Windows convergence

- Move guard, modality-input, and modality-background assertions into shared,
  WPF, WinUI3, capture, launch, or desktop-scope owners.
- Preserve every current failing action as a failing required-delivery cell or
  an issue-linked optional cell. Do not convert it to a green refusal.
- Add Windows desktop-scope to the canonical run.
- Delete the three transitional files only after cell-by-cell parity.

Exit: Windows has no guard/modality family, and every background cell has both
target-state and desktop-side-effect evidence.

### Slice 4: macOS and Linux convergence

- Adopt the common case/result runner in AppKit, SwiftUI, and GTK3 tests.
- Replace canonical early-return skips with preflight failures.
- Split Linux schema checks from real desktop behavior.
- Rename capture and desktop-scope ownership files.
- Move AppKit scroll and real-app checks to explicit optional issue lanes.

Exit: native cells emit the same records as shared cells, X11 and Wayland are
separate dimensions, and macOS failures distinguish TCC from driver behavior.

### Slice 5: Flake and fixture cleanup

- Replace fixed coordinates with discovered geometry.
- Allocate CDP ports per process.
- Replace sleeps with deadline polling on external markers.
- Add fixture generation-token reset and reuse harness processes only after it
  proves clean state.
- Prune fixture controls and markers with no live selector or oracle reference.

Exit: no canonical cell depends on VM-specific coordinates, fixed shared ports,
or an unexplained sleep.

### Slice 6: CI validation and deletion

- Keep the complete macOS matrix green after `install-local` and TCC preflight.
- Keep the accepted GitHub-hosted Windows matrix as the canonical result; use
  an optional RDP runner only for environment-parity investigations.
- Keep the accepted Linux X11 and Nix source runs as the supported Linux gates.
- Run pure Wayland as an experimental issue-linked lane until `#1922` closes.
- Compare old/new cells before each transitional file deletion.
- Update contributor docs and the PR description from the generated catalog.

Exit: every declared cell is delivered, refused according to contract, or
fails with a linked unresolved bug. Environment failures are separate.

## Deletion Gates

A test or fixture path may be deleted only when:

1. every assertion maps to a CaseSpec or unit/optional owner;
2. the replacement oracle is equal or stronger;
3. old and replacement outcomes were compared on each affected OS;
4. a required-delivery failure remains visible;
5. refusal cells use an explicit allowed code and desktop-side-effect proof;
6. runners, docs, and artifact labels stop referencing the old target in the
   same change;
7. the reporter finds no missing declared cells.

## Definition Of Done

- Rust has one typed behavioral catalog and one result schema.
- Required GUI prerequisites cannot pass through early returns.
- Test status and observed driver behavior are separate fields.
- Every supported action has foreground/background coverage by distinct driver
  route, with reasons for omitted combinations.
- Every delivered action has an external target-state oracle.
- Every background or refusal cell has desktop-side-effect evidence.
- No permanent guard, modality, or delivery test family remains.
- No `#[should_panic]` known-gap E2E test remains.
- No orphaned target is counted as coverage.
- Shared and native harnesses emit the same result/evidence shape.
- Unit/protocol tests stay desktop-independent and video-free.
- Windows, macOS, and supported Linux X11 complete runs produce classified
  outcomes and per-cell evidence links. Experimental Wayland and environment
  failures stop or fail explicitly without producing a false behavioral pass.
