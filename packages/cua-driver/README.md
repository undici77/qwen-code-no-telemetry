# Cua Driver

Background computer-use driver for any agents. Speaks MCP over stdio; drives native macOS apps without stealing focus.

**[Documentation](https://cua.ai/docs/cua-driver)** - Installation, guides, and API reference.

## Claude Code computer-use compatibility

Standard Claude Code MCP registration:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio cua-driver -- qwen-cua-driver mcp
```

If you want Claude Code's vision/computer-use-style flow to ground on QwenCuaDriver window screenshots, register the compatibility mode:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio cua-computer-use -- qwen-cua-driver mcp --claude-code-computer-use-compat
```

This keeps QwenCuaDriver's normal MCP tools and changes only `screenshot`, which requires `pid` and `window_id` and captures that window only.

Use MCP for this Claude Code vision/computer-use-style path. CLI screenshots still work as QwenCuaDriver calls, but they do not expose the `mcp__cua-computer-use__screenshot` tool name that Claude Code appears to use as the image-grounding cue.
