/// entry point that call sites wrap around AX actions on backgrounded apps.
///
/// Two-layer stack:
///
/// 1. **Enablement** — set `AXManualAccessibility` /
///    `AXEnhancedUserInterface` on the application root. Needed before
///    Chromium/Electron targets will even respond to attribute-level
///    action dispatch. No-op on native Cocoa apps.
/// 2. **Synthetic focus** — write `AXFocused` / `AXMain` on the target's
///    enclosing window and `AXFocused` on the element itself before the
///    action, restore on the way out. Makes AppKit's internal state
///    machine behave as if the action came from the focused process,
///    which prevents the common "target app flashes to the front because
///    AXPress tripped a reflex activation" failure mode.
///
/// A third layer (intercepting the resulting focus-return events on the
/// session event tap) is intentionally not implemented here — it needs
/// private kCPS SPIs we don't want to take a dependency on yet. The two
/// layers present are sufficient for the common case of driving
/// backgrounded AppKit apps.
