//! Switch on Chromium / Electron accessibility for the whole desktop session.
//!
//! Chromium — and therefore every Electron, CEF, and Chrome-based app — ships
//! its accessibility tree disabled and only builds it once it believes an
//! assistive technology is listening. It decides that by watching the
//! freedesktop accessibility status published on the session bus: the
//! `org.a11y.Bus` service exposes an `org.a11y.Status` interface whose
//! `ScreenReaderEnabled` property is the signal. Until that property is true a
//! Chromium window registers either nothing or an empty application on the
//! AT-SPI registry, so [`crate::atspi`] walks an empty tree and
//! `get_window_state` reports the app as having no elements — it is invisible
//! to the driver. Electron apps shipped as AppImages behave identically; they
//! embed the same Chromium.
//!
//! A real screen reader (Orca) turns the tree on simply by writing that status
//! property when it starts. We do the same once, at daemon startup. Because the
//! status object lives on the session-scoped accessibility-bus launcher rather
//! than in our process, the flag is session-wide, outlives us, and takes effect
//! retroactively on apps that are already running — no relaunch and no
//! per-application command-line flag. GTK and Qt gate their own AT-SPI bridges
//! on the companion `IsEnabled` property, so setting it warms those toolkits
//! too.
//!
//! Everything here is best-effort. A session without an accessibility bus (some
//! headless or minimal setups) just yields an error we log and ignore; enabling
//! accessibility must never be able to fail daemon startup.
