/// Why a SendInput drag is needed at all: the PostMessage drag path posts
/// `WM_LBUTTONDOWN` + `WM_MOUSEMOVE`s + `WM_LBUTTONUP` to the target HWND.
/// PostMessage does NOT update the per-thread keyboard state that
/// `GetKeyState(VK_LBUTTON)` reads, so frameworks that poll the button-held
/// state during their drag handler (WPF's Thumb.IsDragging logic does this
/// via Mouse.LeftButton, which polls GetKeyState) never observe the button
/// as down and the drag is a no-op. SendInput goes through the system
/// input queue and DOES update GetKeyState, so a WPF Slider thumb actually
/// tracks the drag.
///
/// Same UIAccess constraints as [`send_click_synthesized`] — the
/// `SetForegroundWindow` swap is rejected from non-UIAccess processes
/// when foreground-lock is active; route through `cua-driver-uia.exe`
/// for reliable operation.
