//! Background keyboard injection via PostMessage.
//!
//! WM_CHAR — posts a character code; simpler and more reliable for text entry.
//! WM_KEYDOWN/WM_KEYUP — used for non-printable keys (Enter, Tab, arrows, F-keys, etc.)
//!
//! All messages are posted async (PostMessageW), so they do NOT steal focus.
//!
//! Modern XAML / WinUI3 / UWP targets reject PostMessage-based keyboard
//! injection because their CoreInput dispatcher only consumes events from
//! the system input queue, not posted messages. This module exposes
//! [`is_xaml_host_hwnd`] so callers (e.g. the `type_text` tool) can route
//! around the PostMessage path for those targets — see CUA-543 and
//! `tools::impl_::TypeTextTool` for the routing logic. The actual UIA
//! `ValuePattern.SetValue` injection lives in the tools layer alongside
//! the existing `set_value` tool; this module deliberately stays
//! Win32-only so the unit tests don't depend on UIA initialisation.

//   2. Owning process .exe basename matches a known XAML-hosted .exe.
//
// The EXE-basename signal is the more reliable of the two: cross-session
// `GetClassNameW` can return nothing, and modern apps like Win 11 Notepad
// keep the legacy `"Notepad"` window class even though they render XAML
// underneath. Diagnostic data captured by `tools::DebugWindowInfoTool`
// (see CUA-543) confirms `notepad.exe` is the reliable signal for modern
// Notepad; class name is not.
