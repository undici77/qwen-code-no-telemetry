//! Foreground-steal bypass for UWP / XAML / WinUI UIA activation calls.
//!
//! UWP/XAML/WinUI apps self-foreground during UIA `InvokePattern.Invoke`
//! (and `ExpandCollapse.Expand`, `Toggle.Toggle`, `SelectionItem.Select` —
//! anything the XAML message-loop processes as an input-like event). The
//! XAML host unconditionally calls `SetForegroundWindow(self)` when handling
//! those, stealing focus from whatever the user had on top.
//!
//! Wrapping the call in `EnableWindow(host, FALSE) / call / EnableWindow(host, TRUE)`
//! silently suppresses the self-activation while letting the UIA pattern call
//! still execute — UIA pattern delivery uses the kernel accessibility channel,
//! not the input queue gated by `EnableWindow`.
//!
//! Empirical evidence (`flash-repro/14-multi-uwp-v3.ps1`, 2026-05-24):
//!   - Baseline UIA Invoke against UWP Calculator num5 button: user's
//!     foreground window dropped below the target in 91% of poller samples.
//!   - With this bypass: 0/507 z-drops across Calculator, Clock, Settings.
//!
//! Non-UWP / classic Win32 apps don't exhibit the bug
//! (`flash-repro/15-non-uwp.ps1`, Notepad: 0/45 baseline z-drops). The bypass
//! is therefore gated on `crate::input::is_xaml_host_hwnd` and is a no-op
//! for non-XAML hosts.
