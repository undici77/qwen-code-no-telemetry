//! Session lifecycle hooks.
//!
//! The cua-driver daemon (`serve.rs`) drives ONE shared `ToolRegistry`; every
//! `cua-driver mcp` proxy process connects to it and shares its state. A
//! proxy-minted `session_id` (carried in the daemon request envelope) lets the
//! daemon OWN and CLEAN UP per-session state.
//!
//! Recording ownership lives on the core `RecordingSession` directly. But some
//! session-scoped state is platform-specific (e.g. macOS per-session config
//! overrides in `platform-macos::tools::SessionConfigRegistry`) and the daemon
//! only holds an `Arc<ToolRegistry>` — it can't reach into a platform crate's
//! `ToolState`. This module bridges that gap with a small process-global list
//! of cleanup callbacks: each platform registers a `Fn(&str)` once at startup,
//! and the daemon's `session_end` arm fans the disconnecting `session_id` out
//! to all of them.
//!
//! This mirrors the existing screenshot/AX-snapshot callback pattern in
//! `recording.rs` — a registry-free, platform-pluggable hook set with no
//! reverse coupling from core into the platform crates.
