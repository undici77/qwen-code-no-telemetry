//! First-launch permissions gate — CLI flow.
//!
//! Rust port of Swift's `PermissionsGate` (SwiftUI panel + polling).  The
//! Rust port intentionally drops the SwiftUI window and reimplements the
//! flow as a terminal-only experience:
//!
//!   1. Inspect TCC state on `serve` startup.
//!   2. If any required grant is missing, print a clear explanation
//!      (which grant, why cua-driver needs it, what to do next).
//!   3. Open the relevant `System Settings` pane(s) via the
//!      `x-apple.systempreferences:` URL scheme.
//!   4. Poll TCC state every second.  Emit a "still waiting" line every
//!      5 seconds so the user knows the daemon is still alive and what
//!      it is waiting for.
//!   5. As soon as everything flips green, print a confirmation and
//!      return — `serve` proceeds normally.
//!
//! Opt-out: `--no-permissions-gate` flag or
//! `CUA_DRIVER_RS_PERMISSIONS_GATE` set to `0` / `false` / `no` / `off`
//! (case-insensitive) skips the entire flow.  Intended for CI / headless
//! automation where blocking on user input would deadlock the runner.
//!
//! Why no GUI window: the Swift gate uses AppKit + SwiftUI which would
//! require a full overlay + NSApplication run loop just to display a
//! dialog.  cua-driver-rs already has a separate AppKit thread for the
//! cursor overlay, and grafting another window onto it is a recipe for
//! main-thread deadlocks.  A terminal-driven flow is uglier but reliable
//! and works headless (with the opt-out flag), which is exactly the
//! audience for the Rust port.
//!
//! A future enhancement could open a native `NSAlert` via objc2 for a
//! more polished look — left as a follow-up; CLI is the MVP.
