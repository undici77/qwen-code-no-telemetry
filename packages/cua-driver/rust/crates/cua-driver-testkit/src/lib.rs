//! Shared test harness for cua-driver integration tests.
//!
//! Before this crate, every `tests/*.rs` re-implemented the same machinery:
//! `workspace_root()` / `driver_binary()` (×9), the JSON-RPC-over-stdio client
//! (`send`/`call`/`init`, ×10), the Windows kill-on-close Job Object reaper
//! (×2), and the `result_text`/`is_error` response accessors. This crate is the
//! single home for all of it.
//!
//! ## Two transports, one shape
//! cua-driver is driven two ways, and a test should be able to target either:
//!   - **MCP** ([`McpDriver`]) — one long-lived `cua-driver` server over stdio
//!     JSON-RPC. State (e.g. `set_config`) persists for the connection.
//!     Returns the `{"result":{"content",…,"structuredContent"}}` envelope.
//!   - **CLI** ([`CliDriver`]) — a stateless `cua-driver call <tool> <json>`
//!     process per action. Prints `structuredContent` (or text) directly, NOT
//!     the JSON-RPC envelope.
//!
//! Both implement [`Driver`] and normalize their differing payloads into one
//! [`ToolResponse`], so a scenario reads `resp.text()` / `resp.structured()` /
//! `resp.is_error()` regardless of transport. This is what makes the
//! transport axis (CLI vs MCP) testable instead of MCP-only.
//!
//! ## Child hygiene
//! [`ChildReaper`] kills every spawned child on drop. On Windows it also assigns
//! them to a `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` job, so the OS reaps the whole
//! tree even on panic / SIGKILL / Ctrl-C — no orphaned windows or held ports.
