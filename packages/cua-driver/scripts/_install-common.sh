#
# Bash counterpart to CuaDriverInstall.psm1. Both files have to stay in
# lockstep on the kill / probe behaviour so a Mac/Linux dev fix matches
# what install.ps1 does on Windows. Function names mirror the
# PowerShell side:
#
#   stop_cua_driver_daemons          ↔  Stop-CuaDriverDaemons
#   show_cua_driver_daemon_survivors ↔  Show-CuaDriverDaemonSurvivors
#
# This script is sourced (not exec'd) by the per-backend install
# helpers:
#
#   * _install-rust.sh           (production Rust delegate)
#   * _install-local-rust.sh     (dev Rust installer)
#   * _install-local-swift.sh    (dev Swift installer)
#
# Loaders: on-disk first when run from a checked-out tree, else fetched
# from GitHub raw via `curl` (mirrors the irm | iex path that
# install.ps1 uses to import the .psm1 over the network). The inline
# loader is duplicated in each consumer because `source` doesn't have a
# bootstrap function the way PowerShell's `Import-Module` does — kept
# minimal so the duplication cost stays low.
#
# Keep this file narrow on purpose: every byte gets curl'd on every
# `curl ... | bash` install on non-macOS hosts (where install.sh
# auto-delegates to the Rust path) AND on dev installs. Things that DO
# belong here: kill / wait / probe helpers that multiple consumers
# need. Things that DON'T: anything only one script uses (leave it
# inline there).
#
# Style:
#   * No `set -e` — sourced helpers shouldn't change the caller's shell
#     options. Caller scripts are already `set -euo pipefail`.
#   * Best-effort everywhere: every external command is suffixed with
#     `|| true` (or wrapped in a subshell) so a kill failure never
#     aborts the surrounding install.
#   * Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS default). No associative arrays, no
#     `[[ =~ ]]` patterns that need bash 4+.

# Best-effort kill of any running cua-driver daemons so the next
# `cua-driver` invocation starts the FRESH binary, not whatever's still
# in memory from the pre-upgrade install. Without this the previous
# daemon keeps running (and on macOS keeps holding TCC-attributed file
# handles) until the user logs out — which surfaces as "the bug I just
# fixed is still there" because the in-memory code is pre-fix.
#
# Layered escalation, in order of decreasing politeness:
#   1. macOS: `launchctl unload <plist>` on every LaunchAgent we know
#      we install (com.trycua.cua-driver-rs.plist for the Rust port,
#      com.trycua.cua_driver_daemon.plist for the Swift driver). Unload
#      is the documented way to stop a launchd-managed daemon — it
#      also clears the KeepAlive flag so launchd doesn't immediately
#      respawn the process we're about to kill. No-op (with stderr
#      suppressed) when the plist isn't installed.
#      Linux: `systemctl --user stop cua-driver-rs.service` for the
#      install-local --autostart path. Same shape — politely stop the
#      supervisor first so it doesn't restart the process.
#   2. `pkill -x qwen-cua-driver` as the backstop for processes that weren't
#      launchd/systemd-supervised (e.g. a manual `qwen-cua-driver serve`
#      from a dev shell, or `qwen-cua-driver mcp` spawned by an editor that
#      isn't aware we're swapping the binary out from under it).
#
# Daemon-name coverage:
#   This vendored fork's binary execs as `qwen-cua-driver` (a distinct
#   product name so it coexists with any upstream `cua-driver` install —
#   see build-app.sh `--identifier com.qwencode.cua-driver` and
#   _install-rust.sh `BINARY_NAME="qwen-cua-driver"`). One `pkill -x
#   qwen-cua-driver` targets exactly this fork's daemon. `cua-driver-uia`
#   is a Windows-only helper (see
#   packages/cua-driver/rust/crates/cua-driver-uia/) and never exists on
#   macOS/Linux, so no pkill for it here.
#
# Returns: always 0. Caller threads this through unconditionally; the
# behaviour is "kill what we can, never block the install".
