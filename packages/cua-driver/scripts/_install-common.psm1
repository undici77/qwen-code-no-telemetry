# _install-common.psm1 - shared helpers for install.ps1 + install-local.ps1.
#
# Both scripts import this module to avoid drift in the daemon-kill logic.
#
#   * install-local.ps1 runs from a checked-out repo, so it imports the
#     module from disk via $PSScriptRoot/_install-common.psm1.
#   * install.ps1 is fetched via `irm | iex` and has no file on disk
#     during execution. It uses Import-CuaDriverInstallModule (below)
#     which prefers the on-disk copy when available (dev / CI) and
#     falls back to fetching the .psm1 from GitHub raw.
#
# Keep this module narrow on purpose - it's loaded over the network in
# the production install path, so every additional line is paid for in
# install latency. Things that DO belong here: kill / wait / probe
# helpers that both scripts genuinely need. Things that DON'T: anything
# that's only used by install-local (it can stay in install-local.ps1
# directly) or anything that pulls in a heavy module dependency.

# Best-effort kill of any running cua-driver / cua-driver-uia processes
# so the next `cua-driver autostart kick` / `cua-driver mcp` starts the
# FRESH binary, not whatever's still in memory. Without this the
# previous daemon keeps running (and keeps drawing its overlay window)
# until the user reboots - which surfaces as "the bug I just fixed is
# still there" because the in-memory code is pre-fix.
#
# Layers of escalation:
#   1. schtasks /End - terminates an autostart-task instance. Task
#      Scheduler runs as SYSTEM so it can kill High-IL processes that
#      a Medium-IL shell can't. /End on an instance the current user
#      registered does NOT need admin.
#   2. taskkill /F /IM - Medium-IL backstop for any process that
#      wasn't task-attached.
#   3. Returns the surviving process list so callers can warn the user
#      (these are the processes a Medium-IL shell genuinely can't reach
#      - High-IL daemons whose parent wasn't `cua-driver-serve`).
