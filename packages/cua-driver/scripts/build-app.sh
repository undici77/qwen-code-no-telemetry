# still works on contributor machines without a cert.

# Bundle ends up at .build/QwenCuaDriver.app — not production, just for dev

# Prefer Developer ID Application cert if available; fall back to ad-hoc.
# `security find-identity` prints identities as:
#   1) <SHA> "Developer ID Application: Team Name (TEAMID)"
# We AWK the SHA hash out of the first matching line (not the display
# name — on dev machines where two Developer ID Application certs
# share the same common name, codesign would reject the name as
# "ambiguous", whereas the SHA is always unique). If two or more certs
# are present we just take the first — in practice they're both valid
# for the same team.
#
# --timestamp=none is intentional: Apple's timestamp server needs
# network access, which contributors may not have or may not want on
# every dev build. Signatures without a trusted timestamp are still
# valid locally — they just can't be distributed via notarization
# without re-signing at release time.
