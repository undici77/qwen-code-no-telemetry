// Persist a skill's invocation arguments to a file, so the skill can *read*
// them instead of asking the model to copy them out of the conversation.
//
// The arguments already reach the model: the slash-command loaders append the
// raw invocation to the skill body. But a skill that needs its arguments as
// *data* — to hand to a parser, to a subcommand, to anything deterministic — has
// until now had to ask the model to transcribe them into a file, and a
// transcription is a recall.
//
// It recalls wrong. Dogfooding `/review 6771`, the model wrote `--effort high`
// into the argument file: not the user's argument, but an **example** lifted out
// of the skill's own documentation. The parser did its job perfectly on the input
// it was given, resolved the target as a local review, found a clean working
// tree, and reported "no changes to review". A request to review a pull request
// became a no-op, and nothing anywhere raised an error — the one failure shape
// a review must never have.
//
// So the CLI writes the arguments down at launch, verbatim, before the model has
// any say in it. Nothing to copy, nothing to miscopy.
