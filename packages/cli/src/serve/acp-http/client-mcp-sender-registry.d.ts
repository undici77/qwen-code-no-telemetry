/**
 * Reverse tool channel — parent-side sender registry + provider (issue #5626,
 * Phase 2).
 *
 * The daemon WS (parent process) holds a per-connection `ClientMcpRegistrar`
 * that carries `mcp_message` JSON-RPC frames down to the extension. But the
 * agent's `McpClientManager` — where the matching `sendSdkMcpMessage` binds —
 * runs in the `qwen --acp` CHILD process. The child reaches back up via the
 * `qwen/control/client_mcp/message` ext-method, which `BridgeClient.extMethod`
 * answers by looking up a sender for the named server.
 *
 * This module is the glue:
 *   - `ClientMcpSenderRegistry` is the process-scoped map `serverName →
 *     sendSdkMcpMessage` shared between the bridge (`clientMcpSender` option)
 *     and the WS provider (below). The serve layer creates ONE per daemon.
 *   - `createClientMcpServerProvider` builds the `ClientMcpServerProvider` the
 *     WS connection injects. On `mcp_register` it (1) records the WS
 *     registrar's `sendSdkMcpMessage` in the registry, then (2) asks the bridge
 *     to add an SDK-type runtime MCP server in the child. The child's manager
 *     spawns an `SdkControlClientTransport` whose `sendMcpMessage` is the
 *     session-scoped `client_mcp/message` ext-method — which the bridge routes
 *     back through the registry to the WS. Tool discovery happens entirely
 *     inside that handshake; the returned `toolCount` is what the child
 *     reported.
 *
 * Wire (full round-trip):
 *   extension --WS--> daemon: mcp_register{server}
 *   provider: registry.set(server, wsRegistrar.sendSdkMcpMessage)
 *   provider: bridge.addRuntimeMcpServer(server, {type:'sdk', __clientMcpOverWs}, clientId)
 *     -> parent->child ext: workspaceMcpRuntimeAdd
 *     -> child: addRuntimeMcpServer(sdk-type) -> SdkControlClientTransport
 *     -> child agent runs MCP initialize/tools/list:
 *          child: sendSdkMcpMessage(server, jsonrpc)
 *          -> child->parent ext: client_mcp/message{server, payload}
 *          -> BridgeClient.extMethod -> registry.get(server) -> wsRegistrar
 *          -> daemon --WS--> extension: mcp_message{id, server, payload}
 *          -> extension --WS--> daemon: mcp_message{id, payload: result}
 *          -> wsRegistrar.resolveMessage -> ext result -> child agent
 *     -> child returns toolCount -> provider acks `mcp_registered`
