/**
 * Daemon-local workspace skills enumeration.
 *
 * `/workspace/skills` is normally answered by the ACP child (which owns the
 * live `SkillManager`). But the child is not always available before the
 * first prompt: session creation is deferred until then, and the startup
 * preheat can time out on a slow cold start — most visibly under
 * `npm run dev`, where the child is transpiled on demand and its
 * `initialize` handshake routinely exceeds the 10s preheat budget, so no
 * channel ever comes up. In that window the child cannot list skills, which
 * drops skill-backed slash commands (e.g. `/review`) from the Web Shell's
 * pre-first-prompt autocomplete even though the skills exist on disk.
 *
 * This provider enumerates skills directly from the filesystem via
 * `SkillManager`, with no child and no MCP initialization, so the daemon can
 * answer `/workspace/skills` instantly whenever the child is unavailable.
 * `SkillManager.listSkills()` only reads a handful of `Config` getters
 * (safe/bare mode, project root, active extensions), so a lightweight config
 * shim is sufficient — no full `Config` construction (and no `initialize()`
 * side effects) required. The live child, when present, stays authoritative:
 * the facade only falls back here after a real child answer and the cached
 * last answer are both unavailable, and this daemon-local view intentionally
 * omits extension-provided skills (there is no active-extension context
 * outside the child) — those still surface once a session exists.
