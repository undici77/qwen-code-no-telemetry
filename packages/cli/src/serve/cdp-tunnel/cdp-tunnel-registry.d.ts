 *
 * The `/acp` WS layer registers an outbound `cdp_*` sink here when an extension
 * becomes the active CDP bridge; the `/cdp` endpoint looks it up to build a
 * {@link CdpReverseLink}. Single daemon = single extension = single browser, so
 * at most one bridge is held (last-writer-wins; a reconnect supersedes a stale
