 * of the write (the `…Safe` writers above catch that) and an asynchronous
 * `'error'` event on the stream, which crashes the process as an unhandled
 * error unless a listener is present. This destroys the stream on the async
 * path — the convention `cost-ledger` and `nonInteractiveCli` use. Call it
 * once at the top of a command handler whose stdout IS its result, so a
 * reader that leaves cannot crash the process AFTER the work is done (for a
 * command that has already mutated state, that turns a completed action into
 * a crash-class exit). Idempotent listeners are fine — a CLI handler runs
 * once and the process then exits, so nothing detaches them.
