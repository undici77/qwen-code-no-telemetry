**Background & Purpose:**

The `findLastSafeSplitPoint` function finds an index where a large or
streaming Markdown string can be split. It prefers Markdown-friendly boundaries
so rendered history chunks do not break fenced code blocks unnecessarily.

**Behavior, in priority order:**

1.  **No split if already short enough:**
    * When `idealMaxLength` is provided and `content.length` is less than or
      equal to it, return `content.length`.

2.  **Fenced code block safety:**
    * If the search endpoint is inside a fenced code block, split before that
      block when possible.
    * When a length cap is provided and the block starts at the beginning of
      `content`, return the cap instead. This intentionally hard-splits
      oversized leading code blocks so streaming pending render items stay
      bounded.

3.  **Markdown-aware newline splitting:**
    * Prefer the last double newline (`\n\n`) at or before the search endpoint.
    * When a length cap is provided, fall back to the last single newline (`\n`)
      at or before the cap.
    * Chosen newline split points must not be inside a fenced code block.

4.  **Fallback behavior:**
    * Without `idealMaxLength`, preserve the historical conservative behavior:
      return `content.length` when no safe block boundary exists.
    * With `idealMaxLength`, return the cap when no safer boundary exists. This
      keeps a single very long line from remaining one ever-growing pending
      render item.

/**

 * fence types are recognized. The run length matters: `indexOf('```')` matches
 * only the first 3 chars of a longer run, so callers must advance past the whole
 * run (index + length) or a 6-backtick fence would be miscounted as two.

 * identical fence. Open/close matching mirrors CommonMark / MarkdownDisplay: a
 * fence only closes a block opened with the SAME character AND a run at least as
 * long, so a ``` inside a ~~~ block — or a shorter run inside a longer fence —
 * does not toggle the state.
