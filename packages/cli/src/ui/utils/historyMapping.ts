  // counting it here desynchronizes the API prompt count from the UI turn
  // count and makes the walk below truncate one turn early, silently
  // dropping a turn the UI still shows. Match the FULL generated
  // placeholder shape, not just its prefix: microcompaction never rewrites
  // text parts, so a user prompt that merely begins with the prefix (e.g.
  // a pasted placeholder) is genuine and must keep counting. An entry that
  // mixes placeholders with real prompt text still counts (it IS a real
  // turn).
  //
  // Known limitation (exact-match collision): a genuine prompt whose ENTIRE
  // text equals a generated placeholder shape is indistinguishable from a
  // cleared media-only entry once serialized — both carry the identical
  // text. Such a prompt is excluded here, leaving the API prompt count one
  // behind the UI turn count. Every rewind target AFTER the colliding turn
  // then returns -1 and AppContainer surfaces a loud "Cannot rewind to a
  // turn that was compressed" abort. Rewinding TO the colliding turn itself
  // depends on position: as the first post-compression turn it works via
  // the uiUserTurnCount === 0 shortcut; mid-history the walk lands on the
  // next counted prompt and truncates one turn LATE, so the colliding
  // turn's prompt+response stays in model context while the UI removes the
  // turn (under-deletion of context, not loss of context the UI keeps).
  // Disambiguating any of this durably needs a structural sentinel on
  // cleared parts, which changes the persisted API history shape and is out
  // of scope for this fix; see the pinned tests in historyMapping.test.ts.
  //
  // The ACP session's private `#isUserTextContent`
  // (packages/cli/src/acp-integration/session/Session.ts) deliberately
  // keeps the bare text-presence check (`'text' in part && part.text`),
  // which counts these placeholders: ACP rewind maps against per-prompt
  // file-history snapshots, which ARE created for media-only prompts, so
  // cleared placeholders must stay counted there. Do not mirror this
  // exclusion into that twin.
