 * - User text prompts (corresponding to UI user turns)
 * - Model responses (with optional functionCall parts)
 * - Tool result entries: user(functionResponse) + model(response)
 *
 * This function counts user text Content entries (skipping tool results

 * Note: In IDE mode, additional user Content entries may be injected for
 * IDE context. This function does not account for those and will produce
 * incorrect results. Rewind is therefore disabled in IDE mode (guarded
 * in openRewindSelector).

 * @param uiHistory The full UI history array
 * @param targetUserItemId The ID of the user HistoryItem to rewind to
 * @param apiHistory The current API Content[] array
 * @returns The number of Content entries to keep, or -1 if the target turn
 *   could not be located (e.g., it was absorbed by chat compression).
