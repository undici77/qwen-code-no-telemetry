/**
 * Runtime reproduction of the non-VP overflow flicker root cause.
 *
 * AppContainer reserves room for the footer with
 *   availableTerminalHeight = terminalHeight - controlsHeight - ...
 * where `controlsHeight` is measured from the controls box (which contains the
 * LiveAgentPanel) inside a `useLayoutEffect` gated by a dependency array. The
 * panel grows as agents launch, but the panel's only self-driven re-render is a
 * per-second elapsed-time tick that never changes the roster. So unless the
 * roster is part of the measurement effect's deps, the effect does not re-run
 * when an agent launches: `controlsHeight` stays stale, `availableTerminalHeight`
 * stays too large, the pending region overflows the terminal, and every repaint
 * forces the view back to the bottom with a flicker.
 *
 * This test faithfully mirrors that exact measurement contract on a minimal
 * component — real ink render, real `measureElement`, real
 * `getLiveAgentPanelLayoutKey` — and shows that:
 *   - WITHOUT the roster key in the deps, a roster that grows leaves the
 *     measured controls height (and thus availableHeight) stale; and
 *   - WITH the roster key in the deps, the controls are re-measured and the
 *     reserved room shrinks to match — which is exactly the one-line fix
 *     applied in AppContainer.
