 * Framework-neutral stream aggregation window.
 *
 * One place for the 60ms coalescing semantics shared by the renderers:
 * token-level events arrive far faster than a terminal frame, so
 * consecutive events merge into one group per window, while consumers
 * flush pending groups at turn boundaries (flushNow) or drop them on a
 * failed attempt (discard), preserving cross-kind ordering and
 * turn-boundary semantics. The constant below and its tests are the
 * canonical record of the window value until a design document lands.
 *
 * This module must not import react / solid / ink / @opentui — the rule is
 * enforced by `scripts/check-tui-dep-direction.mjs` (wired into CI via
 * `npm run check:tui-dep-direction`).
