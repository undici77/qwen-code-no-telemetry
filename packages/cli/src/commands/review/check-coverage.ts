// `qwen review check-coverage`: read what the review agents actually returned,
// and say which parts of the diff nobody looked at.
//
// This exists because the review approved a pull request that no agent read.
//
// Dogfooded against its own PR, the orchestrator launched 25 agents over an
// 18-chunk, 4 925-line diff. Twenty-two of them came back in under two seconds
// having made **zero tool calls**, returning about nineteen tokens each — the
// length of the words "No issues found." They had not opened the diff. The three
// that did work were the three whose jobs do not require reading it: the one that
// runs the build, the one that queries the issue tracker, the one that greps for
// tests.
//
// The prompt already had three defences against this, and all three are prose:
// every chunk agent "MUST" end with a `Covered:` receipt; the orchestrator "MUST"
// verify that every chunk carries exactly one; an agent returning "near-instantly
// with almost no output did not do its job". The run performed none of them,
// reported zero findings, wrote "Not reviewed: none", and filed an Approve.
//
// A rule a model is asked to remember is a rule that will eventually not be
// remembered — this file's whole PR is a list of proofs of that. So the check
// moves to where it cannot be forgotten: the agents' returns are handed to a
// subcommand, verbatim, and the subcommand decides what was covered. The
// orchestrator can still lie — it copies the returns — but fabricating eighteen
// receipts is an act, and every failure this skill has actually suffered has been
// an omission.

 * The floor a return has to clear to count as evidence of a walk.
 *
 * The whiffing agents returned ~19 tokens — "No issues found." is sixteen
 * characters. The prompt requires a no-finding return to name what it examined,
 * and its own example (`No issues found — traced all 7 changed exports to their
 * call sites; every caller compiles against the new signature`) runs to 108. So
 * the floor sits well under that: a check strict enough to reject the prompt's
 * model answer is a check that fails closed on good work, and the cost of that
 * is a relaunch of an agent that had already done its job.
