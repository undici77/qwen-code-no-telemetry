// `qwen review scratch-tree`: a private copy of the PR head for one verifier to
// mutate, so the tree everyone else is READING stays exactly as the PR left it.
//
// Step 4's verifier was the last review step still writing into the shared tree
// (Agent 7's efficacy probe has had a disposable sibling since #6832): it
// writes a probe, runs it, applies the one-line fix the finding implies to show
// the probe flips, and restores. Until now it did all of that in the shared
// review worktree — the tree `working_dir` pins every other agent to as well.
//
// That is a race, and the pipeline's own shape is what makes it structural
// rather than unlucky: round k's verifiers are launched in the SAME response as
// round k+1's reverse auditors ("Verification rides alongside the next round"),
// so a verifier's probe is live in the tree precisely while auditors read it.
// Measured on a real review (#9207): a round-5 auditor read `compose-review.ts`
// carrying a probe's mutant plus a leftover `__probe__.test.ts`, and came within
// a step of filing a Critical against code no commit contains. It recovered by
// improvising `git show HEAD:` — a fallback no brief mentions. Two other agents
// in the same run reported the residue.
//
// "Leave the tree as you found it" — which the verifier brief has always said,
// and which verifiers do obey — cannot close this: the exposure window is DURING
// the probe, not after it. The only fix that removes the window is a tree of
// one's own, which is the pattern this pipeline already uses twice: the
// test-efficacy probe's `-probe` sibling (#6832) and the A/B's `-base` sibling.
// This is the third, and the last mutating step that lacked one.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT do: run anything. Like `base-tree`, it owns the
// fiddly half — a detached add at the right SHA, a leftover from a crashed run,
// a dependency farm so a unit harness can actually start — and hands back a
// path. WHAT to probe is the verifier's question, and no fixed scenario fits it.
