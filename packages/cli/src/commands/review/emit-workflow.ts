// `qwen review emit-workflow`: the Step 3A fan-out as a workflow the runtime
// dispatches, instead of a roster the orchestrator hand-launches.
//
// `--roster` and this command build the same prompts from the same plan
// through the same function (`buildLaunch`). What differs is who launches
// them. `--roster` prints ~13 blocks and asks the orchestrator to copy each
// one into an agent call, in a single response, without editing any of them —
// three conventions this skill's gate list exists because they get broken.
// This command writes those prompts into a script file, so the orchestrator's
// call carries one path and no payload.
//
// What this does NOT change, deliberately: the briefs, the prompts, the
// roster, the coverage evidence, and how findings come back. The agents are
// the same agents reading the same briefs. That is what makes an A/B against
// the hand-launched path readable.
//
// Nothing routes through this command yet. The skill still builds its roster
// with `agent-prompt --roster`; this command exists so the generated dispatch
// can be evaluated on its own before the skill is taught to ask for it.
