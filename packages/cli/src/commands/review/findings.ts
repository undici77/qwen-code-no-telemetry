// `qwen review findings`: the review's findings as data, and the per-finding
// outcome ledger `--fix` writes back into it.
//
// Everything else in this pipeline that matters is already a computed artifact —
// the diff plan, the coverage report, the resolved anchors, the verdict — and the
// findings were the conspicuous exception: prose in a terminal, re-typed into the
// saved report, re-typed again into the review JSON. Three transcriptions of the
// same list, and this skill's own history is a catalogue of what transcription
// does (a Critical that changed severity between two sections of one review; an
// aggregate that lost its per-location anchors on the way to `resolve-anchors`
// and took the whole batch down with it).
//
// Two jobs, and the second is the reason the first exists:
//
//  1. **Canonicalize.** One id per finding, one ordering, one severity spelling,
//     a `shortSummary` short enough for a list UI, counts nobody recomputes by
//     hand. Downstream reads the artifact instead of the prose.
//
//  2. **Account for every finding after `--fix`.** When the fixer has run, every
//     finding must come back carrying an outcome — `fixed`, `skipped`, or
//     `no_change_needed` — and this command **refuses an outcome set that does
//     not cover all of them**. That refusal is the whole point. A fixer that
//     applies six of nine findings and reports six has not lied about any one of
//     them; it has silently shortened the list, and the reader has no way to see
//     the three that fell off. Partial coverage is the failure mode, so partial
//     coverage is the error.
