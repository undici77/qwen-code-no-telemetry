// Defect-LAYER coverage for a diff that models an external executable system.
//
// The reverse audit's stop rule is "two consecutive dry rounds": no auditor
// found a new gap. That is sound evidence about the layer the auditors walked
// and silent about every layer they did not. On a guard that re-implements a
// shell — PR #8687 — the abundant TOKEN-layer bypasses (a comment that eats the
// command, a glob, an `-oc` bundle) filled every round while the STATE layer
// (what a function/eval/subshell propagates or drops) went unexamined; a dry
// round on the token layer said nothing about it, and the loop could converge
// with a whole class untouched. "No new gaps" needs to become "which layers has
// nothing been filed against."
//
// A layer counts as COVERED when an auditor RECEIPTED it — a structured line,
// `Layer walked: <id> — <note>`, whose note may record a finding or a clean
// walk. Coverage is the RECEIPT, not the finding: a marker-less finding does not
// count its layer, so an auditor must name every layer it walked. The marker has
// the exact shape and discipline of the `Budget gap:` line (budget.ts): a line
// the parser reads, not a phrase it guesses at. Keyword inference exists too, but only as an OPT-IN estimate for
// measuring transcripts recorded before the auditor brief asked for the marker
// (the A/B baseline); the marker is the authority, because an agent parrots what
// it is handed and a coverage claim guessed from prose is the same self-consistent
// blind spot the layer taxonomy exists to break.
//
// This module is pure: it computes coverage, it decides nothing. The cap that
// consumes it — one `unreviewedDimensions` entry per unwalked layer, which can
// only withhold an Approve, never end the loop — ships alongside it in
// `layer-audit-gate.ts`. What stays deferred behind an A/B is the RISKIER half:
// letting an unwalked layer EXTEND the reverse-audit loop rather than only cap
// the verdict. Nothing here can make the loop stop sooner.
