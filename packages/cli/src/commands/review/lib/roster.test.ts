// The subject is an agent that was never launched, on a review that certified the
// diff anyway.
//
// Every other check in this skill asks a question of an agent that ran — was it
// given the diff, did it open it, was it handed the prompt the CLI built. An agent
// that does not run leaves no transcript to ask, so its absence is invisible
// precisely because it is an absence. Dogfooded against a real PR, Agent 0 (issue
// fidelity) was simply not launched, and nothing in the run could tell.
//
// The cure is a list of who should have been there, derived from something other
// than the thing doing the launching. These tests pin that derivation.
