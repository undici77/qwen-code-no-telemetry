// The delivery check, and the two ways it was wrong.
//
// It began as a straight substring test — "the built prompt must appear in the
// launch prompt" — and that is a stricter claim than the skill actually makes.
// Dogfooded on a Step 3B review it failed **all nine agents**, and both differences
// were legitimate: the orchestrator had inserted the one-sentence summary of the
// change that the skill explicitly tells it to add, and it had reflowed a
// hard-wrapped sentence onto a single line.
//
// A gate that fires on a correct run is worse than no gate. This skill has the
// transcript of a model reading a refusal, deciding "the agents clearly did their
// job", and walking past it — and it was right to, that time. So the rule the check
// enforces is the rule the skill states: **you may add; you may not remove, alter,
// or reorder.**
