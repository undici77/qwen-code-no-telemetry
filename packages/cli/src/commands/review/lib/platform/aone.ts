  //    strip runs on the PATH portion only — an `@` inside a query or

  //    closed in `take` — it must never fold into a fabricated host.

  //    DIFFERENT server than the parsed identity named. No userinfo
  //    cleaning here — the parse regex owns it.

  // string credentials (`?private_token=…`, a real CI pattern) would
