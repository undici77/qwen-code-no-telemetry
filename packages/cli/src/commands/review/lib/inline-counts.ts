// after `submit` stopped, and a dogfooded report-only run — which never reaches
// `submit`'s recount — moved its one Critical from the body list to an inline
// comment, dropped the count on the way, and `compose-review` printed
// `Verdict: Approve` over a Critical the report itself listed. One counting
// function, fed by the comments array both callers already hold.
