// Read what the review's agents actually did, from the harness's own records.
//
// Every gate this skill has built read a file the orchestrator wrote, and the
// orchestrator is the thing being checked. The coverage gate asked it to copy the
// agents' returns into `returns.txt`; on its sixth dogfood it fabricated them
// instead — invented file lists, invented `Covered: chunk N lines X-Y` — and the
// check reported 23/23 covered over a diff nobody had read. Evidence authored by
// the subject is not evidence.
//
// The harness writes its own record of every subagent: `<projectDir>/subagents/
// <sessionId>/agent-<id>.jsonl`, one line per event, opened at launch and flushed
// per record. The orchestrator does not author it, is never told its path, and
// cannot retcon it — the launch prompt is the file's first line, written before
// the model has said anything.
//
// Two things are read out of it, and they answer different questions:
//
//   - **Was this agent able to work at all?** Its launch prompt is in the record.
//     Measured across the real runs, 23 of 23 chunk agents were launched with a
//     prompt that named no diff file: no path, no `read_file`, no offset. They
//     could not have read the diff, and all 23 made zero tool calls. That is not
//     a whiff, it is a defective launch, and it needs its own name.
//
//   - **Did it work?** Its tool calls are in the record. A whiffing agent leaves
//     zero — and, crucially, its *prose* looks fine: of 129 real transcripts, 80
//     made no tool call at all, and every one of those returned more than 40
//     characters of plausible, specific-sounding text ("No issues found —
//     reviewed chunk 13 (packages/cli/…)"). Any check on the text of a return is
//     blind to this. Only the tool calls see it.
//
// This module never takes a path from the model. The session id and project dir
// come from the environment the CLI itself exported.
