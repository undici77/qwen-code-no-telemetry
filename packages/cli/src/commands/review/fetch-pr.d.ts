 * Both thresholds are coarse on purpose, and the reason is that the two sides
 * are produced by DIFFERENT tools: `--find-renames` is pinned locally while
 * GitHub applies its own, so a move whose similarity lands on opposite sides of
 * the two thresholds shrinks one side and not the other. The 4x is what buys
 * past that — a threshold disagreement moves the ratio by one file, a genuine
 * upstream collapse moves it by the size of the PR — and the 200-line floor
 * keeps small PRs, where one file IS the ratio, out of it entirely. A
 * disclosure, never a gate, precisely because it is not the same quantity
