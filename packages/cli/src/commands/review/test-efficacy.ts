// `qwen review test-efficacy`: does the diff's new test actually gate the
// diff's new behaviour?
//
// Agent 5 and the test-coverage matrix ask whether a test EXISTS and whether
// its assertions look like they check something. Neither question can catch the
// two ways a test ships without protecting anything:
//
//   1. UNREACHABLE — the project's test command never runs the file. On PR
//      #6486 the new test lived in `integration-tests/`, which is not an npm
//      workspace, so `npm test --workspaces` never collected it; and its CI job
//      (`Integration Tests (CLI, No Sandbox)`) was skipped. The test executed
//      nowhere, in CI or in review, and nothing noticed.
//   2. INERT — it runs, it passes, and it would still pass with the source
//      change reverted. #6486's did: it drove a kitty CSI-u sequence into a PTY
//      that never negotiated the kitty protocol, so the keypress was discarded
//      before it could reach the handler under test. The test could only ever
//      have caught a startup crash.
//
// Both are decidable without judgment, which is why they live here in TypeScript
// rather than in a review agent's prompt. Findings carry `Source: [test]` and
// are pre-confirmed like Agent 7's — they are the outcome of running commands,
// not of reading code.
//
// The revert probe is the load-bearing half, and its trap is the third outcome:
// reverting the source can make the test fail to COMPILE (it imports a symbol
// the new code introduced). That failure is not evidence the test gates
// anything, and calling it "gated" would be exactly the false assurance this
// command exists to remove. So `gated` requires a real assertion failure, and
// everything else that is not a clean pass is `inconclusive`.

 * exists to find. (Found by running it, not by unit-testing it. The unit tests
 * for the run-level classifier all passed.) `testResults[].name` carries the
 * file, so the mapping is available; use it.
 *
 * The three-way asymmetry is deliberate:
 *
 * - `inert` — this file's tests PASSED with the source change reverted. They do
 *   not gate the change. This is a finding.
 * - `gated` — at least one ASSERTION in this file failed. It caught the revert;
 *   it is doing its job. Requires a real assertion failure, never a bare
 *   non-zero exit: reverting source routinely breaks a test's own compile (it
 *   imports a symbol the diff introduced), and a compile error proves nothing
 *   about whether the test would catch a behavioural regression.
 * - `inconclusive` — everything else: the file collected nothing, an
 *   import/type error, unparseable output. Do NOT let this read as `gated`; a
 *   review that mistakes "it errored" for "it caught the bug" is back where it
 *   started.
