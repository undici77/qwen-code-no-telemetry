// `qwen review agent-prompt`: build a review agent's launch prompt in code.
//
// The prompt used to be composed by the orchestrator, from a paragraph of the
// skill's instructions telling it what to include. Measured against the harness's
// own record of what the agents were actually launched with — the first record of
// each subagent transcript, written at launch and not retconnable — the
// orchestrator did not include it:
//
//   23 of 23 chunk agents were launched with a prompt that named NO diff file:
//   no `diffPathAbsolute`, no `read_file`, no offset, no limit. All 23 made zero
//   tool calls.
//
// They were handed a *description* of a chunk they had no way to open ("The
// changes are in chunk 13 of 23, covering lines 3808-4024 of the diff"), and a
// sentence to say if they found nothing ("If you find no issues, say 'No issues
// found — reviewed chunk 13 (...)'"). They said it. Every one of them.
//
// So the agents never whiffed. They were launched blind, and then dutifully read
// their line. The receipts they returned — which looked like proof of work — were
// in the prompt that launched them.
//
// This is the same failure this skill has now fixed five times over: a rule the
// prompt states in prose is a rule that will eventually not be followed, and the
// fix is always to move it into code that can say no. It was applied to the
// review target, the posting gate, the verdict, and the coverage report. The
// agent's own prompt — the thing that decides whether a review can happen at all
// — was the one place it was not.
//
// The orchestrator now asks for the prompt instead of writing it. What comes back
// carries the diff path, the agent's exact byte range, and the paging and
// uncoverable rules, because those are not things a caller should be trusted to
// remember.
