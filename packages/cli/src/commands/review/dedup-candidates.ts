// The pre-verify carried-ledger dedup (issue #10105).
//
// On a re-review round the Step 3 finders re-derive findings earlier rounds
// already reported, and every one of them used to ride a Step 4 verify shard
// before the posting layer dropped it as a duplicate — the most expensive
// point in the pipeline, repeated every round for as long as the original
// threads stay open (measured on PR #9729: rounds 12 and 13 confirmed 7 and 8
// already-reported Suggestions each, all verified first). This command is the
// mechanical step between the finder union and the verify shard: it matches
// the pooled candidates against the carried ledger — the prev-ledger side
// file's posted work list, plus the previous round's saved findings
// artifact's deferral entries when that artifact exists on this machine AND
// is from the side file's own round — and drops a match before any verifier
// is spent on it. In the spirit of #7751's
// script-lint gate, the model is out of the matching loop: the report it
// writes is what the orchestrator shards from and what `compose-review`
// reads to disclose the set-aside count.
//
// The matching is deliberately conservative. A false NEGATIVE costs nothing
// new — the candidate rides to verification and the posting layer's
// duplicate drop remains the backstop, exactly the status quo — while a
// false POSITIVE would silently lose a genuinely new finding before any
// stage could recover it. So a drop requires the same file, anchor
// proximity when both sides carry a line, and high claim similarity — and a
// Critical candidate is never dropped against a non-Critical entry, so an
// escalation always reaches verification. A dropped candidate's claim is
// not lost either way: a matched posted finding is a ledger entry Step 6
// still rules on against the code (the ruling never leans on this drop),
// and a matched deferral stays on the standing deferral record.
//
// Trust shape: the side file is recovered from the posted review body,
// another account's writable surface. A planted entry can therefore divert a
// matching candidate from the verify shard — but the entry it matched is
// then ruled by Step 6 against the code like any carried finding, so the
// claim degrades to ruling rigor rather than disappearing, and the severity
// guard keeps a planted Suggestion from touching any Critical candidate.
