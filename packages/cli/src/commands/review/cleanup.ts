// The command is idempotent — missing files / branches are silent OK.

 * comment's `updatedAt` is the resolution instant, indistinguishable from a
 * body edit — so the edited arm skips resolved comments entirely; a
 * posted-then-resolved bypass is still caught by the posted arm. That skip
 * opens the third disclosed residual: an EDIT of an UNVOUCHED pre-window
 * comment is invisible once its discussion is resolved — the `--resolved`

  //   to keep — the CI retry re-captures the plan at the same path, and

  //   refusals write one), but its records predate the retry's fresh plan
  //   capture — nothing clears the record dir between runs. A file older
