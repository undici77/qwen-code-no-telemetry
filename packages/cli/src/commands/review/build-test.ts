// `qwen review build-test`: run the project's own build and tests over the code
// the PR actually changed, and report what happened as data.
//
// Agent 7's brief was a paragraph. It named `npm run build`, then `npm test`, and
// set a 120-second timeout on each. Measured against the harness's own subagent
// transcripts — the record the agent does not write — that paragraph produced
// **139 command timeouts across 89 review sessions, 71 of them `npm run build`**.
// On this repo a cold full build takes 125 seconds. The deadline the skill set was
// five seconds short of the command the skill mandated, so *every* high-effort
// review spent two minutes proving nothing, and then spent several more model
// turns discovering the timeout, ruling it "environmental", and improvising a
// narrower command — which is the command it should have been handed.
//
// Three things are therefore decided here rather than in prose:
//
//   - **The scope.** A two-file PR in one package does not need the other fifteen
//     built. The plan report names every changed file; the root package.json names
//     the workspaces; the build set follows. For PR #6866 that is 6 packages, not
//     19 — 65 seconds, not 125.
//
//   - **The widening.** A workspace's declared dependencies UNDER-approximate what
//     its compile needs: `vscode-ide-companion` maps a tsconfig path straight into
//     `../cli/src`, so its typecheck compiles CLI sources and needs a package it
//     never declares. Modelling that statically over-approximates instead (all of
//     the CLI's dependencies get dragged in). So the set is not predicted — it is
//     *corrected*: build it, and when the compiler says `TS2307: Cannot find module
//     '@scope/pkg'` about a workspace package, add that package and try again.
//     It converges on the minimal correct set and needs to model nothing.
//
//   - **The deadline.** A command that runs out of time is an infrastructure
//     result, not a defect in the diff, and it is reported as one. A review must
//     never file "the build timed out" as a Critical against a PR.

  // run here it overlaps the other agents, which are still reading.
  //
  // A non-zero exit is NOT the end of the run, and finding that out cost a live
  // review. `npm ci` executes the project's `prepare` lifecycle script, and this
  // repo's runs `npm run build` and `npm run bundle` — the whole monorepo. On the
  // PR under review that build hit a **pre-existing** type error in a package the
  // diff does not touch, `npm ci` exited 1, and this command gave up having built
  // and tested nothing: the one deterministic signal a review has, withheld
  // because an unrelated package failed to compile during an install.
  //
  // The packages were installed. `node_modules` was on disk. So the test is not
  // the exit code, it is whether the tree we need is there — and the scoped build
  // below is the authoritative answer anyway. Report the install failure, and
  // carry on to ask the question the review actually came to ask.
  //
  // A **timeout** is the exception, and it is not the same case. A `prepare` hook
  // that fails leaves a *complete* `node_modules` and only the post-install build
  // broken; a timeout kills `npm ci` mid-download and leaves a **partial** tree.
  // Building against that produces "module not found" errors that look like defects
  // in the diff and are not — so a timed-out install aborts, exactly like an install
  // that left no tree at all.
  //
  // Whether to install is gated on npm's **completeness marker**, not the bare
  // directory. `npm ci` writes `node_modules/.package-lock.json` only once the tree
  // is fully materialised, so a partial tree — left by a timeout here, or by the
  // agent's own shell-tool kill one level up — has the directory but not the marker.
  // Gating on the directory would let every later run *skip* the install and build
  // against that partial tree; gating on the marker reinstalls it.
  //
  // But `npm ci` is only right for an npm repo. `workspaces` is also yarn/bun/pnpm
  // syntax, and those write no `package-lock.json`, so `npm ci` would fail-fast on
  // the missing lockfile and mislabel a perfectly usable `node_modules` as a failed
  // install. So install only when there IS a `package-lock.json` (an npm repo) whose
