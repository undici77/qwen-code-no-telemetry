 * Side channel for `mid_turn_message_injected` daemon events. Patterned on
 * {@link ./followupSidechannel.ts}, but ACCUMULATING rather than latest-wins:
 * the session event pump parses each raw frame and publishes here, appending to
 * a buffer that a consumer (`useDaemonMidTurnInjected`) drains via
 * `useSyncExternalStore` and then clears. Kept out of the transcript reducer
 * because it is a transient UX signal — the consumer moves the matching messages
 * out of its own pending queue (so they are not resent as the next turn) rather
 * than rendering anything from it. (Followup can be latest-wins because only the
 * newest suggestion matters; mid-turn drains are cumulative — every batch must
 * be reconciled or its messages get double-delivered.)

// Two frames can therefore land before the consumer's effect runs; a single-
// slot store would drop the first, and its messages would never be removed from
// the browser's pending queue (⇒ resent next turn = the double delivery this
// feature prevents). Every batch is retained until the consumer reconciles it
// and calls `clearSidechannelMidTurnInjected`. `EMPTY` is a shared frozen ref so

 * therefore deliberately NOT removed and survive for their own reconcile:
 *
 * - Batches for a DIFFERENT session — the buffer is a cross-session singleton, so
 *   on an in-place session switch a frame for the previous session can still be
 *   buffered. It was never reconciled against this session's queue, so wiping it
 *   would lose it on switch-back (resent next turn = double delivery).
 * - Batches that arrived AFTER the consumer's render snapshot (the render→effect
 *   window) — they aren't in `handled`, so a blanket clear would drop them
 *   unreconciled. Identity-removal leaves them for the next effect run.
 *
 * Clearing only what was reconciled is what makes the dedupe exactly-once across
 * both the multi-session and the late-frame races.
