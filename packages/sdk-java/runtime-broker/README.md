# Qwen Managed Runtime Broker State

This Java 21 module defines the durable state boundary for a future Managed
Agent Runtime Broker. It contains Runtime binding and Runtime Session records,
repository contracts, and thread-safe in-memory implementations for tests and
single-process prototypes.

This foundation intentionally does not provision Runtime processes, expose an
HTTP API, call the Hosted Harness, or track tool execution. Those integrations
belong to later PRs that depend on this module.

Building and running this module requires JDK 21 or later. Its Maven release
target is 21; services embedding the resulting JAR must also use JDK 21 or later.

Build and test with:

```bash
mvn test
mvn checkstyle:check
```

## JDBC persistence

`JdbcRuntimeBrokerSchema.initialize(DataSource)` installs the three private
Broker tables. The JDBC implementations use only `javax.sql.DataSource`; the
embedding service owns the connection pool and schema lifecycle. This module
intentionally does not persist Tool executions or wire a Spring service.

Run the optional real-MySQL contract with:

```bash
mvn -Pmysql-integration \
  -Dmysql.url='jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/runtime_broker_test' \
  -Dmysql.user=root \
  -Dmysql.password= \
  verify
```

Durable rows alone do not make a stopped local Runtime process recoverable.
The embedding service must reconcile a persisted lease before reuse and own the
process adoption or reprovisioning policy.
