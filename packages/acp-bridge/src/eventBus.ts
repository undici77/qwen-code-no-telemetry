/**
 * Event-bus for the daemon's per-session NDJSON stream.
 *
 * Design notes (from the threat-model):
 *   - Each event carries a monotonic `id` (per session) so the SSE
 *     `Last-Event-ID` reconnect protocol can pick up where the client left
 *     off. Backed by a bounded ring of recent events for replay.
 *   - Subscribers use bounded async queues. A slow subscriber that blows
 *     past its queue limit is sent a final `client_evicted` event and
 *     closed; this keeps a stuck client from holding the daemon hostage
 *     (per the resource-exhaustion entry in the threat-model summary).
 *   - The bus is push-based; consumers iterate the returned AsyncIterable.
 *     Aborting the supplied AbortSignal closes the iterator promptly.

/**
 * Promise-based bounded queue. `push` returns false (instead of blocking or
 * throwing) when full so callers can decide how to react — the EventBus uses
 * that signal to evict slow subscribers.
 *
 * The cap (`maxSize`) applies only to LIVE items pushed via `push()`. Items
 * inserted via `forcePush()` (the `Last-Event-ID` replay path on subscribe,
 * the terminal `client_evicted` frame, and the mid-stream
 * `slow_client_warning` frame) carry a `forced` tag per entry and never
 * count toward the cap. Without this split, a reconnect with a large
 * backlog would force-push ~ringSize entries into `buf`, push `buf.length`
 * past `maxSize`, and the very next live publish would evict the
 * just-resumed subscriber — defeating the resume contract.
 *
 * Previously this class tracked `forcedInBuf` as a count, which was
 * correct only when forced frames stayed contiguous at the FRONT of the
 * buffer (subscribe-time replay). The `slow_client_warning` path
 * force-pushes mid-stream to the BACK of the queue, so the count-based
 * approach drifted: a live shift would decrement `forcedInBuf`, then a
 * later cap check on a live push would under-count the live backlog and
 * warn/evict the client before there were actually `maxSize` live
 * items. The per-entry `forced` tag below is the position-independent
 * fix.
