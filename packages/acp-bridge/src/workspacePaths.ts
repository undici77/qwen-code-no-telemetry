 * Maps a Windows-shaped absolute path to the container mount produced by the

 * `getContainerPath` in `cli/src/utils/sandbox.ts`).
 *
 * A Windows host relaunching `qwen serve` into a Linux Docker/Podman sandbox
 * translates the bind mount and `--workdir`, but path-valued CLI arguments
 * (`--workspace C:\…`), client-registered workspaces, and persisted
 * registrations reach the in-container daemon in host shape. Left alone,
 * `path.resolve` on Linux mangles them further (prepends the cwd) and every
 * ACP child spawn fails with `chdir(2) ENOENT` before running anything
 * (#7139).
 *
 * Deliberately conservative — the input is returned unchanged unless ALL of:
 * - the daemon is running on POSIX inside a container sandbox (`SANDBOX` env
 *   set by the launcher; macOS `sandbox-exec` does not remap paths and is
 *   excluded),
 * - the path is Windows-absolute (`<drive>:\…` or `<drive>:/…`),
 * - the translated candidate actually exists (i.e. the drive really is
 *   mounted the way the launcher mounts workspaces).
 *
 * The `opts` seams exist for tests; production callers use the defaults.

/**
 * Canonicalize a workspace path so the boot-time bound path and every
 * request's `workspaceCwd` collapse to the same key. `path.resolve`
 * alone normalizes `..` and `.` segments and absolutizes, but on
 * case-insensitive filesystems (macOS APFS, Windows NTFS) `/Work/A`
 * and `/work/a` are the same directory yet `resolve` returns them
 * verbatim — without normalization the `boundWorkspace` check would
 * reject every request that spelled the path with different casing
 * and `sessionScope: 'single'` re-attach would silently degrade to
 * "one per spelling".
 *
 * `realpathSync.native` (when the path exists) walks symlinks and returns
 * the on-disk casing; this matches what `config.ts` / `settings.ts` /
 * `sandbox.ts` use for their own workspace resolution. When the path
 * doesn't exist (test fixtures, ahead-of-mkdir flows) we fall back to
 * the resolved-but-uncanonicalized form rather than throwing — the
 * downstream `spawn({cwd})` will fail with a useful ENOENT if the
 * workspace truly doesn't exist.
 *
 * NOTE: This is a **cross-module contract** — `config.ts`,
 * `settings.ts`, `sandbox.ts`, and the bridge layer all need to
 * canonicalize the same way for the bound-workspace check +
 * `sessionScope: 'single'` re-attach to work correctly across paths.
 * The contract: use `realpathSync.native` on the resolved absolute
 * path; fall back to `path.resolve` only when the path doesn't exist
 * yet.
 *
 * Lifted to `@qwen-code/acp-bridge` in #4175 PR 22b so the bridge
 * package owns the cross-module primitive directly.
 * `cli/src/serve/fs/paths.ts` re-exports for callers still pointing
 * at the original location.

 * Single enforcement point for the workspace-ingestion ordering (#7139):

 * host-shaped input before `canonicalizeWorkspace`'s own translation could
 * ever see it. Every ingestion site calls this instead of hand-rolling the
 * translate-then-isAbsolute pair, so a future sixth endpoint cannot forget
 * the ordering.

 * Returns the translated path, or null when it is not absolute — callers
