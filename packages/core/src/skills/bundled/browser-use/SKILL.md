# Browser Use

Browser Use is bundled with Qwen Code and uses the generic Node REPL MCP tools
and the Qwen Chrome extension. Do not install a separate Qwen extension or
start a separate Browser Use MCP server.

## Setup

The Qwen Code Chrome extension must already be installed. On macOS and Linux,
the SDK checks for it before automatically registering the local Native
Messaging host. If it is not detected immediately, the SDK retries for up to
30 seconds so Chrome can finish saving a new installation. If setup still
cannot detect it, tell a user who just installed it to wait a few seconds and
retry; if it is not installed, tell them there is no store listing yet: build
the extension from `packages/chrome-extension` in the Qwen Code repository (its
README) and load the built `dist/extension` directory through
`chrome://extensions` (Developer mode → Load unpacked). Then stop. Do not run
the Native Host installer to bypass this check.

Installing the Chrome extension opts into this automatic local setup. Its
Native Host files persist after Qwen exits. The user can inspect or remove
them with `node <skill-base>/runtime/scripts/native-host-setup.js status` or
`uninstall`. Removing the Chrome extension also prevents automatic registration
on a later Browser Use initialization.

If `node_repl` is unavailable, configure it with:

```bash
qwen mcp add --scope user node-repl npx -y @qwen-code/node-repl-mcp@0.1.6
```

Then tell the user to restart Qwen Code and stop. Do not start a separate
Browser Use MCP server. Screenshot metadata requires `@qwen-code/node-repl-mcp`
0.1.6 or later, so keep this exact pin.

Qwen reports the absolute `Base directory for this skill` when loading this
file. Use that directory as `<skill-base>`. Confirm that
`<skill-base>/runtime/index.js` and
`<skill-base>/runtime/node_modules/playwright-core/package.json` exist. If
either is missing, stop and report an incomplete Browser Use runtime instead
of installing dependencies into the workspace. Before the first Node REPL
cell, call `node_repl_add_node_module_dir` once with the absolute
`<skill-base>/runtime/node_modules` path. Import the bundled SDK, replacing the
example skill base below with that absolute path:

```js
globalThis.browserAgent ??= await (
  await import('/absolute/skill/base/runtime/index.js')
).setupBrowserRuntime();
globalThis.browser ??= await browserAgent.browsers.get('chrome');
nodeRepl.write(await browser.documentation());
```

Create a tab or claim an exact result returned by `openTabs()`:

```js
globalThis.tab = await browser.tabs.new();
await tab.goto('https://example.com/');
nodeRepl.write(await tab.playwright.domSnapshot());
```

```js
const candidates = await browser.user.openTabs();
nodeRepl.write(candidates);
globalThis.tab = await browser.user.claimTab(
  candidates.find((candidate) => candidate.url === 'https://example.com/'),
);
```

## Interaction

Observe before acting and observe again after acting. Prefer semantic
Playwright locators. Use `tab.dom_cua.get_visible_dom()` and its `node_id`
values when snapshot refs are clearer, and use `tab.cua` for visual coordinate
targets.

```js
await tab.playwright.getByRole('button', { name: 'Continue' }).click();
await tab.playwright.getByLabel('Email').type('user@example.com');
await tab.dom_cua.click({ node_id: 'e4' });
await tab.dom_cua.type({ text: 'hello' });
```

When an action should navigate, arm the Playwright watcher around it:

```js
await tab.playwright.expectNavigation(
  () => tab.playwright.getByRole('link', { name: 'Next' }).click(),
  { url: '**/next.html' },
);
```

Render screenshots with their metadata:

```js
await nodeRepl.emitImage(await tab.screenshot());
```

The metadata reaches the model only through `@qwen-code/node-repl-mcp` 0.1.6
or later; an older server accepts the call and silently drops it. If
`node_repl` was registered before this skill existed, check its command with
`qwen mcp list`, and when it pins an older version, re-register it with the
`qwen mcp add` command from Setup above and ask the user to restart Qwen Code.

Use `tab.dev.logs()` for bounded console diagnostics. Arm
`tab.playwright.waitForEvent('download' | 'filechooser')` before the action that
triggers it. Handle JavaScript dialogs through `tab.getJsDialog()`. Use a
focused `tab.playwright.evaluate()` only when locators cannot obtain the needed
data.

Use `browser.user.history()` only when the task needs browser history, with a
focused query and bounded result count.

## Finish

Treat `browser.tabs.finalize({ keep })` as the final browser action of the turn.
Omitted agent-created tabs close; omitted claimed tabs are released without
closing. `keep` is the complete set for this call. Keep a user-facing result as
`deliverable`, and keep a live page under control as `handoff`. Repeat a
handoff in each later turn that still needs it; omitting it from the next
finalize call or closing the runtime closes an agent-created tab.

```js
await browser.tabs.finalize({
  keep: [{ tab, status: 'deliverable' }],
});
```

The Node kernel preserves `globalThis` and top-level bindings across cells.
Keep cells short, await every Browser SDK promise, and use `nodeRepl.write()` to
return text or structured data.
