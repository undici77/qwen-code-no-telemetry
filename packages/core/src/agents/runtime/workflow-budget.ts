/**
 * @fileoverview P5: WorkflowBudget concrete implementation. P1 reserved
 * the seam (`SandboxOptions.budget`) with throwing stubs so dynamic-loop
 * patterns like `while (budget.total && budget.remaining() > 50_000) { ... }`
 * would survive shape-wise; P5 fills the seam with a real per-run token
 * tracker.
 *
 * Threat model:
 *  - Workflows can dispatch up to 1000 agents per run; a runaway script
 *    can burn through significant token budget without an upper bound.
 *  - The env override `QWEN_CODE_MAX_TOKENS_PER_WORKFLOW` lets operators
 *    set a per-run output-token cap. The cap is a **soft gate**, not a
 *    hard pre-commit reservation: it is checked at dispatch ENTRY in
 *    `countedDispatch`, so concurrent fan-out (`parallel()` /
 *    `pipeline()`) inside the concurrency window can overshoot before
 *    the first overshooting dispatch throws. Worst-case overshoot bound
 *    ≈ `(concurrency_window − 1) × per_dispatch_tokens`, where
 *    `concurrency_window = min(16, cpus−2)` by default (overridable via
 *    `QWEN_CODE_MAX_WORKFLOW_CONCURRENCY`). Operators sizing the cap
 *    should pick a value below the true ceiling by this margin; the
 *    gate matches upstream Claude Code 2.1.168 semantics.
 *  - When the env is unset (`total = null`), there is no cap and
 *    `remaining()` returns `Infinity` — matching upstream's "no target"
 *    sentinel for dynamic-loop callers that gate on `budget.total`.
 *
 * Realm boundary: the impl is host-realm; the sandbox bridge wraps it
 * in a vm-realm shim (workflow-sandbox.ts) so the script sees a
 * vm-realm view whose `.constructor.constructor` cannot reach host
 * primitives — same defense as T1/T8/T14 budget stubs.
