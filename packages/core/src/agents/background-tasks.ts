 * sub-agents whose UI is routed through the same pill+dialog while the
 * parent turn waits on them. Both share the registry (and the dialog
 * wiring) but differ in lifecycle:
 *
 * - `isBackgrounded: true` entries persist across turns, emit a
 *   `<task-notification>` on terminal status (the parent's only return
 *   channel), and contribute to `hasUnfinalizedTasks()` so headless callers
 *   keep their loop alive.
 * - `isBackgrounded: false` entries live for the duration of the parent's
 *   tool-call, are unregistered as soon as `execute()` returns, deliver
 *   their result through the normal tool-result channel (no XML envelope),
 *   and don't participate in the headless holdback.
