 * Access control is filesystem permissions plus a connection token. The
 * socket directory is 0700 and the socket itself is 0600, so only this
 * uid can connect; when `requiredToken` is set, a connection must also
 * present it on its first line before any frame is read, which narrows
 * "can reach the socket path" to "can read this session's 0600 registry
 * record" and is what a permissionless transport (a named pipe) will rely
 * on entirely. A second token, `childToken`, goes only to processes this
 * session spawns, and is the one fact about a sender the inbox can vouch
 * for: a connection that presents it was opened by something this session
 * itself started. Beyond that, a token authenticates the connection, not
 * the sender: Node cannot read `SO_PEERCRED` without a native addon, so a
 * frame's claimed `from` is still unauthenticated and kept only for reply
 * routing — any process holding a token can write any `from` it likes.
 * Everything downstream is built on that assumption: the inbound gate
 * decides whether a message may act, and the envelope tells the model the
 * content is not from its user.
