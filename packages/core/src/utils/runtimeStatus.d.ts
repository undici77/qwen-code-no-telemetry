 * Runtime status sidecar for an active interactive Qwen Code session.
 *
 * This module writes a small JSON file alongside the session's chat log
 * while an interactive session is alive. It exists so that **external**
 * tools (terminal multiplexers, tab managers, IDE integrations,
 * observability daemons) can answer the question:
 *
 *     "Which Qwen Code session is the running PID X serving?"
 *
 * The CLI does not embed the session id in `argv` for fresh
 * (non-resumed) sessions, and the OS process title can be truncated, so
 * a side-channel file that records the explicit
 * `(pid, session_id, work_dir, ...)` tuple is the most reliable
 * cross-platform signal.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 * - Written on session start (clean launch or resume); the resume case
 *   atomically overwrites whatever the previous PID wrote.
 * - **Not** deleted on clean `/quit` or on crash. From an external
 *   observer's standpoint the recorded PID no longer exists in either
 *   case, so a liveness check is sufficient and an explicit cleanup
 *   adds nothing.
 * - `clearRuntimeStatus` exists for the narrow case where the same PID
 *   keeps running while no longer serving the recorded session
 *   (e.g. a hypothetical future mode-switch). Not currently invoked.
 *
 * The file is written via `atomicWriteJSON` (write-to-temp + rename,
 * with in-place fallback when ownership differs).
 * The schema is small and stable; external consumers should treat
 * unknown fields as forward-compatible additions.
