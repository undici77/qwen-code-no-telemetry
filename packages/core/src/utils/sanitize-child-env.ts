/**
 * Env vars that carry Qwen-internal credentials or private parent
 * capabilities. These must never be inherited by a child process the agent
 * launches on the user's behalf — shell commands, the monitor tool, or a stdio
 * MCP server — because no legitimate user command needs them and leaking them
 * to arbitrary agent-run commands is a credential-exposure gap (issue #6601).
 *
 * `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN` is the serve-daemon bearer token, `QWEN_DAEMON_TOKEN`
 * is the channel-daemon worker token, and
 * `QWEN_CODE_PRIVATE_ACP_CAPABILITY` authenticates the daemon-spawned ACP
 * child. Their direct consumers already scrub them from `process.env` after
 * reading them.
 *
 * This denylist is intentionally NARROW: it strips only Qwen-internal secrets,
 * NOT third-party credentials such as `GH_TOKEN`, `AWS_*`, or `NPM_TOKEN`.
 * Real shell workflows legitimately depend on inheriting those (`gh`, the AWS
 * CLI, `npm publish`, …), so stripping them here would break user commands.
 * Broader third-party-credential stripping stays scoped to the sandbox / MCP
 * infrastructure paths where it already lives.
