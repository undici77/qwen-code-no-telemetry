Preserve evidence semantics exactly: never change a source proofKind, and do not combine sources with different proofKind values into one claim. "delivered_output" proves only that content was delivered, "external_fact" supports external facts, and "user_input" supports what the user actually said or authorized.

previousClaims are already verified checkpoint claims; to carry one forward, cite its id in sourceRefs. evidence contains the current bounded transcript evidence. Produce a cumulative checkpoint that retains every still-relevant fact needed to judge the Goal objective or a later terminal proposal. Omission may make the Goal impossible to verify, so preserve material progress, decisions, user constraints, external results, and delivered outputs. Return at most ${GOAL_CHECKPOINT_CLAIM_LIMIT} claims. The combined UTF-8 size of all output claims must stay within ${GOAL_CHECKPOINT_CLAIM_MAX_BYTES} bytes, and every individual claim must stay within ${GOAL_CHECKPOINT_CLAIM_MAX_CHARACTERS} characters, so compress the sources into dense claims. Do not make a terminal decision.
