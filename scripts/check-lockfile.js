// The root `playwright` and Web Shell's `@playwright/test` both drive the

// version. Both manifests carry an exact pin: a range on either side lets a
// regeneration resolve the pair apart and re-nest a second tree, which leaves
// the installed browser one the harness cannot launch.
//
// Three other Playwright declarations are deliberately outside this invariant:
//   - `packages/mobile-mcp` declares `@playwright/test` as a range directly.
//     npm satisfies it from the single hoisted copy at the pinned version
//     today, and the harness never resolves into that workspace, so it stays
//     out of scope here — but it is the only in-workspace range on a name this
//     check pins, which makes it the first manifest to look at when the
//     resolved-version assertion below fires. Do NOT append it to
//     `playwrightManifests` as it stands: the exactness check rejects its range
//     and would turn `check:lockfile` red immediately.
//   - `packages/mobile-mcp` also depends on `mobilewright`, which pins
//     `playwright` and `playwright-core` to an exact older revision no manifest
//     edit here can dedupe. That tree hoists the older `playwright-core` to the
//     root, so the root `playwright-core` bin is NOT part of this parity — only
//     the `playwright` CLIs are.
//   - `integration-tests/terminal-capture` declares a `playwright` range but is
//     not a workspace member, so it enters neither lockfile. Bringing it inside
//     the invariant takes three steps, not one: pin it exact, list the directory
//     in BOTH the root `workspaces` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `packages:`
//     (scripts/tests/package-scripts.test.js asserts the two lists are equal),
//     then append it below and regenerate both lockfiles. Two test-side edits
//     ride with the append: `scripts/tests/check-lockfile.test.js` copies only
//     the manifests its fixtures perturb, so the new one joins its `FILES`, and
//     its third-manifest arm builds a third entry by rewriting a literal copy
//     of the list below — with a real third entry present that arm asserts on a
//     list the file no longer has, so retire it or repoint it at a fourth.
