## Code Review

Project-specific rules for `/review`. The skill loads this section verbatim (by
its `## Code Review` heading) and hands it to every review agent, so keep it to
things a reviewer of _this_ codebase must check — not general advice.

This file is the single home for those rules: `qwen review` reads it whole, and
before it looks at `AGENTS.md` or `QWEN.md`. It used to live under a `## Code
Review` heading in `AGENTS.md`, which meant 684 tokens were resident in every
session as well as re-read on the turns that needed them. Do not restore that
heading to `AGENTS.md` — `npm run check:context` fails if you do.

- **Verify a finding against the exact reviewed commit before reporting it.**
  Read the lines you are about to cite. A Critical that quotes code not present at
  the commit under review is worse than no finding — it blocks the author over
  nothing. Do not report a defect you have only inferred from a symbol name or a
  diff fragment.
- **A `C=0` / APPROVE is a claim, not a default.** Before submitting one, take
  each unresolved Critical already on the PR and check it against the code as it
  stands: _still stands_ / _fixed by this diff_ / _cannot tell_. A GitHub thread
  can read `isResolved: false, isOutdated: false` for a bug that a later commit
  fixed on an adjacent line — the flag tracks the anchored line, not the fix.
- **For every added field, option, or optional parameter, grep its read sites**,
  including outside the diff. A `foo?: boolean` that is declared and read but never
  set by any caller is a dead switch (`options.foo ?? true` always takes the
  default). Decide severity at the read site; never explain an unpopulated field
  with author intent you cannot observe.
- **Classify every added or changed daemon route by ownership.** Name whether it
  is process-global, legacy-primary, selected-runtime, live-session-owner, or
  persisted-workspace scoped, and verify every downstream consumer matches that
  scope.
- **Verify workspace-scoped routes stay inside the resolved runtime.** Check the
  environment, bridge, service, filesystem, trust boundary, and failure paths.
  Each unknown, untrusted, ambiguous, bootstrapping, draining, or removed state
  must follow its declared failure semantics and must never fall back to the
  primary runtime.
- **Match the house style when judging.** ESM only; no `any`; no relative imports
  between packages; `kebab-case.ts` for `.ts` in `packages/core` and `packages/cli`,
  `PascalCase.tsx` for React components; tests collocated as `file.test.ts`.
  Comments default to none — flag a _missing_ comment only where the _why_ is
  genuinely non-obvious, and never fault a diff for deleting a comment that no
  longer applies.
- **A missing test for changed behavior is a Suggestion, not a Critical**, unless
  the untested path is itself the defect.
- **Check design documentation in both languages.** New or updated designs
  must include linked English and Chinese versions with matching structure,
  decisions, constraints, and acceptance criteria. A translation gap alone is
  a Suggestion, not a Critical.
